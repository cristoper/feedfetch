&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders, the formerly-independent senator from Vermont, has already accomplished what seemed impossible: it has further confused the American people about the meaning of &lt;em&gt;socialism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders has consistently referred to himself as a "democratic socialist" for decades. While he was a student at the Univeristy of Chicago (1960-1964) his reading included works by Jefferson, Lincoln, Fromm, Dewey, Debs, Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, Freud, and Reich.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Though his writings reflect a greater influence by Freud and Reich than Debs and Marx, the mere fact that he&amp;#8217;s read Marx and knows of Eugene V. Debs almost makes Sanders a revolutionary leftist by contemporary American standards. In 1979, disappointed that many of the students he spoke with had never heard of Debs, Sanders wrote and produced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w82pFvUq3o8"&gt;a 30-minute narrated film on his life and ideas&lt;/a&gt;. (If &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; have never heard of Eugene Victor Debs and you have any interest in American socialism, it is worth your time to watch Sanders' video or at least skim &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs"&gt;the Wikipedia entry on Debs&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Debs video was so successful that Sanders considered producing &amp;#8220;a video series on other American radicals&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;Mother Jones, Emma Goldman, Paul Robeson, and other extraordinary Americans who most young people have never heard of.&amp;#8221; Unfortunately he never did.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote."&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernie&amp;#8217;s first involvement in electoral politics came in 1971 when he stopped by a meeting of the Liberty Union Party in Vermont and got nominated as the party&amp;#8217;s candidate for an upcoming Senate special election. (Today the Liberty Party is so disappointed in his foreign policy that they have an article linked to the top of their website which refers to him as &lt;a href="http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=363"&gt;&amp;#8220;Bernie the Bomber.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America has been a hostile environment to anyone and anything associated with the &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;-word during Sanders' entire political career, but he has still had impressive success at electoral politics as a self-avowed socialist in Vermont. When he ran for a fourth term as the mayor of Burlington in 1987, the Democratic and Republican Parties finally decided to join forces and run a single candidate against him. Sanders still won (as did his third-party successor, Peter Clavelle, who beat a joint Democratic-Republican candidate in the 1989 election).&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote."&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Even as a senator he still considers Eugene Debs to be a hero of his, and he even at one point had (maybe still has) a plaque commemorating Debs hanging on the wall in his Washington office.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote."&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders has not shied away from the &amp;#8220;socialist&amp;#8221; label during his current campaign; on the contrary, he seems to welcome every interview as a chance to emphasize to the American people that his democratic socialism is nothing scary or radical. He has always been indirect but clear that what he means by &amp;#8220;democratic socialism&amp;#8221; amounts to what is more commonly called &amp;#8220;social democracy.&amp;#8221; But when discussing contemporary political ideas in English, it is generally important not to confuse &amp;#8220;democratic socialism&amp;#8221; with &amp;#8220;social democracy.&amp;#8221; They now mean nearly opposite things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;#8220;democratic socialism&amp;#8221; is used to describe a broad range of approaches which emphasize a bottom-up and peaceful-ish eradication of capitalist ownership and transition to a socialist economy (whatever that might look like). It has come to mark a general distinction between Marxism-Leninism (especially Stalinism) and other socialist traditions both evolutionary/parliamentary and revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, &amp;#8220;social democracy&amp;#8221; usually refers to social and economic reforms which seek a more humane and democratically-controlled capitalist economy. It has come to be almost synonymous with the policies put in place by the Nordic states during the 20th century. In Sanders' terminology, it aims to curtail the excessive political and economic power currently enjoyed by America&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;billionaire class&amp;#8221; in order to restore and maintain a healthy &amp;#8220;middle class&amp;#8221; supported by a Scandinavian-style welfare system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the two terms have not always referred to distinct ideas; a hundred years ago they were used interchangeably. And even while social democracy today doesn&amp;#8217;t challenge capitalism, its reforms did grow out of the broad socialist and labor movements of the 19th century. One of the early theorists of social democracy was a German Marxist named &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Bernstein"&gt;Eduard Bernstein&lt;/a&gt; who became influenced by the British parliamentarian socialists of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Society"&gt;Fabian Society&lt;/a&gt;. Bernstein argued at the turn of the 20th century that capitalism was capable of adapting and reforming itself to provide workers with rights and prosperity so that its collapse was avoidable and its extralegal overthrow was unnecessary. One of Bernstein&amp;#8217;s most famous pronouncements is: &amp;#8220;The final aim of socialism, whatever it may be, means nothing to me; it is the movement itself which is everything.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg"&gt;Rosa Luxemburg&lt;/a&gt;, another German theorist, provided a defense of orthodox Marxism against Bernstein&amp;#8217;s reformism as &lt;a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reform or Revolution?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1900). In language which could be directed at a Sanders-style social democrat today, Luxemburg noted that reforms must be made in relation to a goal, so to divorce the socialist goal from social reforms is to abandon socialism itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[P]eople who pronounce themselves in favour of the method of legislative reform in place and in contradistinction to the conquest of political power and social revolution, do not really choose a more tranquil, calmer and slower road to the same goal, but a different goal. Our program becomes not the realization of socialism, but the reform of capitalism; not the suppression of the wage labor system but the diminution of exploitation, that is, the suppression of the abuses of capitalism instead of suppression of capitalism itself.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Sanders' use of &amp;#8220;democratic socialism&amp;#8221; to refer to mere reforms of capitalism is confusing in its anachronism, it is not without precedent. And there is a specific thread of American socialism that is almost continuous with Sanders' presidential bid and which provides some historic context to help understand the movement building around Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version of that history begins in the late 1950s with a man named &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Harrington"&gt;Michael Harrington&lt;/a&gt; who is today most famous for his 1962 book on poverty (&lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Other_America.html?id=sZDgwcHQmkwC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Other America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Harrington was something of a protégé to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Shachtman"&gt;Max Shachtman&lt;/a&gt;, a long-time member of the American socialist scene and an associate of Leon Trotsky. In 1958 Shachtman and his followers joined the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_America"&gt;Socialist Party of America&lt;/a&gt; (the party which was founded by Eugene Debs back in the day). Shachtman and Harrington argued that the Socialist Party was so small that it should adopt a strategy of &amp;#8220;realignment&amp;#8221;: focusing its energy on joining and realigning the Democratic Party to the left, including voting for and otherwise supporting the Democratic presidential nominees. Since workers weren&amp;#8217;t going to the socialists, they said, the socialists should go to the workers. Harrington thought the New Left arising on American campuses could be the beginning &amp;#8220;not of a &amp;#8216;third&amp;#8217; party of protest, but of a real, second party of the people,&amp;#8221; and that the Democratic Party could be transformed to that end.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_5" title="View footnote."&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington became a leader of the youth wing of the Socialist Party, the Young People&amp;#8217;s Socialist League (YPSL). Significantly, not long after Harrington&amp;#8217;s realignment movement became influential, a young university student and civil rights activist named Bernie Sanders joined the Chicago chapter of YPSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;a class="image" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-bernie-sanders-1963-chicago-arrest-20160219-story.html"&gt;&lt;img src="/log/2016/2/27/a_look_at_bernie_sanders_electoral_socialism/bernie_arrest.jpg" alt="A 21-year-old Bernie Sanders being arrested by the Chicago PD at a civil rights protest in 1963."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="title"&gt;A 21-year-old Bernie Sanders being arrested by the Chicago PD at a civil rights protest in 1963&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disagreement over the realignment strategy contributed to several schisms of the Socialist Party of America in the early 1970s. Harrington resigned and founded the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Socialist_Organizing_Committee"&gt;Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC)&lt;/a&gt; which endorsed the 1972 Democratic candidate George McGovern for president and continued to try to develop a socialist program within the Democratic Party. In 1982 DSOC joined with another democratic socialist group to become the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Socialists_of_America"&gt;Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSA is still alive and, probably unsurprisingly, they are one of the very few socialists groups I&amp;#8217;ve come across who have clearly endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. They are actively organizing grassroots support for Sanders through their &lt;a href="http://www.dsausa.org/"&gt;#WeNeedBernie&lt;/a&gt; campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure if Sanders was directly or consciously influenced by the Shachtman-Harrington realignment caucus back in the '60s, but the movement he&amp;#8217;s building around his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination is perhaps the most successful expression to date of that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to what Sanders means by &amp;#8220;democratic socialism.&amp;#8221; In November 2015 he gave &lt;a href="https://berniesanders.com/democratic-socialism-in-the-united-states/"&gt;an hour-long speech at Georgetown University&lt;/a&gt; to elucidate his meaning. The whole speech including this bit toward the end exemplifies the confusing way he uses the term &lt;em&gt;socialist&lt;/em&gt; to mean something very much like &lt;em&gt;capitalist&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The next time you hear me attacked as a socialist&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;like tomorrow&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;remember this: I don&amp;#8217;t believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families of this country who produce the wealth of this country deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down. I do believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of his talk about &amp;#8220;socialism,&amp;#8221; Sanders proposes no anti-capitalist positions (with the possible exception of his support of worker cooperatives, which is socialist in spirit even if not in the details).&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_6" title="View footnote."&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; He manages to identify working families as the creators of wealth (though without mention of the non-American families who create so much of our wealth), but he never questions the fundamental mechanisms by which that wealth ends up in the hands of employers and bankers. As the editors of &lt;em&gt;Jacobin&lt;/em&gt; magazine summarized his speech, &amp;#8220;In short, for Sanders, democratic socialism means New Deal liberalism&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/bernie-sanders-socialism-franklin-roosevelt-four-freedoms-economic-bill-rights/"&gt;&amp;#8220;The Socialism of Bernie Sanders&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a persistent and widespread misconception which holds that an essential element of socialism is either government control of business or/and it is government funding of services. When Sanders promotes the latter by contrasting it to the former, he manages to reinforce both misconceptions simultaneously. The effect of such a shallow understanding is that the popular definitions of socialism make almost no useful distinctions and socialism talk in America consists almost entirely of debating various forms of capitalist policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is argued by some pragmatic bandwagoners that labels are unimportant and whether we call Sanders a democratic socialist or a social democrat it&amp;#8217;s his message and the movement he is building which are important. Others tack the opposite way: they say the referent is unimportant and we should just be happy someone is finally talking about socialism seriously and positively on TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both views show a rather severe under-appreciation for the importance of radical rhetoric. It is when making modest, mundane reforms that it is most important to keep long-term radical goals in mind; without linguistic reminders, projects will inevitably lose themselves to the prevailing ideology. Likewise, to obscure the radical meaning of socialism as Sanders has done is to cut loose those rhetorical anchors and risk losing any transformative potential of his program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Untangling the various meanings and histories of &lt;em&gt;socialism&lt;/em&gt; to detail its useful distinctions and critiques is beyond the scope of this article. But it is worth pointing out, contra Sanders, that some socialists (even those so wary of being mistaken for Bolsheviks that they insert the redundant &amp;#8220;democratic&amp;#8221; modifier everywhere) still think socialism is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be radical and maybe a little bit scary. The main point of departure between socialists and other reformers is that socialists, historically, have tended to be, you know, &lt;em&gt;anti-capitalist&lt;/em&gt; in their rhetoric and projects. That may seem obvious, but it is a point apparently lost on Sanders and many of his young &amp;#8220;socialist&amp;#8221; supporters. An idea of what it means to be (and to not be) anti-capitalist can be had by comparing the rhetoric of Sanders with that of his hero Debs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders talks about the &amp;#8220;billionaire class&amp;#8221; and the &amp;#8220;middle class,&amp;#8221; or about the &amp;#8220;1%&amp;#8221; and the &amp;#8220;99%&amp;#8221;. Debs talked about the &amp;#8220;capitalist class&amp;#8221; and the &amp;#8220;working class&amp;#8221;; about the &amp;#8220;master class&amp;#8221; and the &amp;#8220;exploited class.&amp;#8221; The class analysis of socialists like Debs has the advantage that it is based on a clearly defined relationship to production rather than on arbitrary levels of income. One points to the symptoms; the other both explains the symptoms and points to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders talks about increasing wages for the middle class. Debs talked about wages as slavery and worked to abolish the wage system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders talks about protecting American jobs, wages, and profits even at the expense of the global poor. In one interview last year he described open borders as a &amp;#8220;right-wing proposal&amp;#8221; which &amp;#8220;would make everybody in America poorer.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_7" title="View footnote."&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Debs talked about a world-wide revolutionary movement and said &lt;a href="http://socialistworker.org/2004-1/500/500_06_Zinn.shtml"&gt;&amp;#8220;I have no country to fight for; my country is the earth; I am a citizen of the world.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders says the USA should be a leader, but not a unilateral actor except as a last resort, in military conflicts. Debs opposed all war and empire. In 1918 he delivered a speech against World War I for which he was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison (of which he served three).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders is seeking the nomination of one of the most powerful capitalist political parties in the history of the world. Debs founded independent parties to challenge the monopoly held by the Republican and Democratic parties of his time. While he was in prison in 1920 he ran for president as the Socialist Party candidate and received nearly a million votes (about 3.4% of the popular vote).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it is not fair to measure any electable socialist politician against Eugene Debs. Who could stand up to that? I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve heard Jeremy Corbyn or Kshama Sawant speak much about abolishing the wage system either. But such a comparison does hopefully cast light on why some socialists are nonplussed about Bernie Sanders. A masseur is no good when what one wants is a surgeon. Band-aids don&amp;#8217;t fix bullet holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_neither_socialism_nor_barbarism_making_america_great_again_again"&gt;Neither Socialism Nor Barbarism: Making America Great Again (Again)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph below shows the share of all income which went to the richest 1% (blue) and 0.1% (red) of American families over a 100-year period from 1913 to 2013:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Income_Shares_of_Top_1%25_and_0.1%25_1913-2013.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/log/2016/2/27/a_look_at_bernie_sanders_electoral_socialism/us_inequality.png" alt="US Income Shares of top 1% and 0.1% Households Including Capital Gains (1913-2013)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="title"&gt;&lt;span class="small"&gt;&amp;#169; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Farcaster"&gt;Farcaster&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode"&gt;CC-BY-SA 3.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the relatively flat bit spanning about thirty years starting after World War II and continuing until around 1978 during which income inequality was at its lowest. The economist Fredrich Hayek referred to those years as the Great Prosperity. They were characterized by Keynesian-inspired welfare policies aimed at maximizing employment and a post-Fordist economy of domestic manufacturing with strong labour unions and high wages. An unprecedented number of workers (among men) made a &amp;#8220;family&amp;#8221; wage and could afford to buy many of the products they helped produce which spurred business and incentivized further domestic investment, jobs, and spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the America Bernie Sanders is nostalgic for. But even while the apparent health of that period (notwithstanding the millions of less-lucky American families who lived in poverty) was made possible by many concessions to the working class (Franklin D. Roosevelt&amp;#8217;s New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson&amp;#8217;s Great Society), those concessions comprised a temporary capitalist alternative to socialism, not its expression. It didn&amp;#8217;t take long after the postwar world stabilized for the capitalist class to remove its restraints whenever convenient to return to a renewed, more profitable liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the current trend of high and rising inequality cannot be sustained indefinitely. If the capitalist state can&amp;#8217;t get control of the capitalists under its charge, then &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; faces a future of economic and environmental ruin. In that sense members of the ruling class, who always have the most to lose, might be wise to feel the Bern. But it&amp;#8217;s not clear that last century&amp;#8217;s methods of saving capitalism would find success again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall U-shape apparent in our graph above was made famous by French economist Thomas Piketty in his book &lt;em&gt;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&lt;/em&gt;. By looking at tax records in the United States, France, Germany, and several other countries, Piketty and his team found that the low-levels of wealth inequality during the Great Prosperity was a singular occurrence, an aberration from the normal path of capitalism on which returns from capital tend to outpace income from labour. (At the bottom of the last page of the copy of Piketty&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#8217;m consulting, a previous library patron penciled this mini-review: &amp;#8220;577 pages to say the rich get richer &amp;amp; the poor get poorer.&amp;#8221;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piketty, who is himself a social democrat with &amp;#8220;no interest in denouncing inequality or capitalism per se,&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_8" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_8" title="View footnote."&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; presents a rather dismal outlook for the future of capitalism. The best try at regaining democratic control over the globalized financial capitalism of this century, he says, would be for nation-states and financial institutions dedicated to transparency to somehow work together to approximate a global progressive tax on capital. But as one reviewer for The &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; responded to Piketty&amp;#8217;s proposed restrictions on capital, &amp;#8220;It is easier to imagine capitalism collapsing than the elite consenting to them.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_9" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_9" title="View footnote."&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; More generally, as a Marxist critic of Piketty pointed out, &amp;#8220;Capitalism can dispense with democracy more easily than with profits.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_10" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_10" title="View footnote."&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The democratic socialist guise of Sanders' New Deal liberalism, then, is a regressive walk back toward an antiquated capitalist society which, in the light of Piketty&amp;#8217;s data and the global nature of modern capitalism, may no longer even be within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course American socialists don&amp;#8217;t expect to be presented with an actual socialist who they can vote for as a viable candidate. But they do have hope that an independent social democrat is possible. Most of the criticism Sanders has received from the socialist press is directed at his strategic choices: specifically the efficacy of working with or within the Democratic Party rather than building an independent political movement to challenge the two capitalist parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;a class="image" href="http://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2014/10/10/bernie-sanders-chess-master"&gt;&lt;img src="/log/2016/2/27/a_look_at_bernie_sanders_electoral_socialism/bernie_chess_2.jpg" alt="Senator Sanders sitting in front of a chess board."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="title"&gt;The senator plots his next move. Original photo by &lt;a href="http://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2014/10/10/bernie-sanders-chess-master"&gt;Charlie Enscoe&lt;/a&gt; (who retains copyrights).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A younger Sanders may have criticized himself on the same grounds. In his book about becoming a US Representative for Vermont he commented on the Labor Party slogan (&amp;#8220;The bosses have two parties. We need one of our own&amp;#8221;) with &amp;#8220;Hard to argue with that.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_11" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_11" title="View footnote."&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; And here&amp;#8217;s an excerpt from that video he wrote about Eugene Debs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every four years the Democratic and Republican parties come forward and tell the working people of this country all they&amp;#8217;re going to do for them. How they&amp;#8217;re going to end unemployment, raise wages, lower prices, and stop war. Gene Debs didn&amp;#8217;t believe a word of it. He believed that the only way that workers could protect their own interests was to have a political party of their own: a socialist party.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socialists who are not optimistic about expending their efforts on the electoral politics of a capitalist party see the Sanders campaign as little more than a mechanism to &amp;#8220;sheepdog&amp;#8221; potential leftists, attracting them to and keeping them within the Democratic Party where any potential for radical change will be dissipated or even redirected toward strengthening the established order. I don&amp;#8217;t know who first coined the phrase, but the ability of the Democratic Party to attract and neutralize radical movements has earned it the reputation among activists as being &amp;#8220;the graveyard of social movements.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perusal of the American socialist press provides many examples of this sentiment. Ashley Smith articulated this position in an article for &lt;em&gt;Socialist Worker&lt;/em&gt;, stating that &amp;#8220;Like many leftists before him, the Democratic Party has co-opted and changed Bernie Sanders, using him to help hinder the development of a genuine alternative to the capitalist parties&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="http://socialistworker.org/2015/05/05/problem-bernie-sanders"&gt;&amp;#8220;The problem with Bernie Sanders,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; 5 May 2015). Again, in &lt;a href="http://socialistworker.org/2015/05/27/an-faq-on-sanders-and-the-left"&gt;&amp;#8220;A socialist FAQ on Bernie Sanders and the left&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; (27 May 2015), the &lt;em&gt;Socialist Worker&lt;/em&gt; unfavorably contrasts the Sanders campaign to the independent presidential runs of Ralph Nader, stating that &amp;#8220;The biggest problem is Sanders' relationship to the Democratic Party. It poses as the &amp;#8216;party of the people,&amp;#8217; but it is, in fact, a capitalist party, funded and controlled by Corporate America and the political elite.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently the International Socialist Organization (the Marxist group which publishes &lt;em&gt;Socialist Worker&lt;/em&gt;) reiterated its non-support for Sanders &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; he is running for the Democratic Party which amounts to &amp;#8220;accommodation with the structures of American capitalism and its state,&amp;#8221; and which &amp;#8220;means hoping to find common ground with a system that is not only built on the ruthless exploitation of all working-class people, but also relies on institutional racism at home and permanent war abroad&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="http://socialistworker.org/2015/09/03/sanders-and-political-revolution"&gt;&amp;#8220;Is Sanders making a "political revolution"?&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;  by Todd Chretien, &lt;em&gt;Socialist Worker&lt;/em&gt;, 3 Septermber 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;World Socialist Web Site&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;WSWS&lt;/em&gt;, the publication of a rather sectarian Trotskyist group) continues to publish some of the harshest criticisms of the Sanders campaign. As an example of a recent analysis, Barry Grey concluded that Sanders' &amp;#8220;central political function is to prevent the emergence of an independent political movement of the working class by channeling social discontent back behind the Democratic Party&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/02/20/pers-f20.html"&gt;&amp;#8220;Once again on Sanders and socialism,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; 20 February 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Hedges, whose liberal audience is more main stream than those who typically read the likes of &lt;em&gt;Socialist Worker&lt;/em&gt;, wrote an impassioned plea against Sanders' engagement with the Democratic Party and for a &amp;#8220;truly socialist&amp;#8221; revolution &amp;#8220;in the streets, not in a convention hall. Convention halls are where the left goes to die.&amp;#8221; He warned Sanders supporters that &amp;#8220;No movement or political revolution will ever be built within the confines of the Democratic Party,&amp;#8221; and predicted that &amp;#8220;His mobilized base, as was true with the Obama campaign, will be fossilized into donor and volunteer lists. [&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;] The political system, as many Sanders supporters are about to discover, is immune to reform&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/bernie_sanders_phantom_movement_20160214"&gt;&amp;#8220;Bernie Sanders’ Phantom Movement,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Truthdig&lt;/em&gt;, 14 February 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even socialist groups and commentators who are overall very excited about the Sanders campaign recognize the dangers of getting involved with the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;em&gt;Jacobin&lt;/em&gt; magazine&amp;#8217;s founder and editor, Bhaskar Sunkara, wrote a very-cautiously optimistic piece welcoming Sanders' challenge to Hillary Clinton (&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/05/bernie-sanders-president-vermont-socialist/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Bernie for President?&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; May 2015): &amp;#8220;Having Sanders openly defend socialism, and contest the New Democrat record before a national audience, is a baby step in the right direction.&amp;#8221; Sunkara&amp;#8217;s expressed hope is that leftist supporters of Sanders will be able to avoid the dead-ends his party offers and instead &amp;#8220;transcend the Democratic Party entirely&amp;#8221; because the resulting movement &amp;#8220;could begin to legitimate the word &amp;#8216;socialist,&amp;#8217; and spark a conversation around it, even if Sanders&amp;#8217;s welfare-state socialism doesn&amp;#8217;t go far enough.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socialist Alternative&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;a recently popular (especially their &amp;#8216;Fight for 15&amp;#8217; minimum wage campaign) Trotskyist group whose website states that &amp;#8220;the Republicans and Democrats are both parties of big business, and we are campaigning to build an independent, alternative party of workers&amp;#8221;&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;tried to hitch a ride on the Bernie train early on and has been enthusiastic in its support for the reforms and rhetoric of Bernie Sanders. But it has also been consistent in its warnings that the movement must not get trapped in the Democratic Party.  &amp;#8220;We need to use the momentum of Sanders' campaign to build a new kind of political organization, independent of corporate cash, in opposition to right-wing Republicans, but also independent from the Wall Street-dominated Democratic Party&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="http://www.socialistalternative.org/2015/08/03/sawant-socialist-bernie-sanders/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Sawant Gives Socialist Welcome to Bernie Sanders&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, 3 August 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise &lt;a href="http://solidarity-us.org/"&gt;Solidarity&lt;/a&gt;, a small independent socialist organization, released a statement in which they expressed hope to connect with the Bernie movement while accusing the Democratic Party of being &amp;#8220;unreformable, committed to imposing capital&amp;#8217;s neoliberal project,&amp;#8221; and that they &amp;#8220;strongly disagree with Bernie Sanders’ approach of running in the Democratic primary and his pledge to support the party nominee&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="http://www.solidarity-us.org/site/node/4490"&gt;&amp;#8220;On Bernie Sanders' Campaign,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; December 2015). And earlier this month the Solidarity Steering Committee warned that &amp;#8220;the energy [Sanders has] captured is all too likely to dissipate in disillusionment and frustration [&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;] &lt;em&gt;unless the movement finds a means of continuing and expressing itself independently from the Democratic Party&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="http://www.solidarity-us.org/site/afteriowanewhampshire"&gt;&amp;#8220;After Iowa and New Hampshire: A Political Revolution Underway?&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; 11 February 2016, emphasis in original).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true, however, that some socialists, recognizing that no such viable independent party seems forthcoming and that the Democratic Party is the more amenable of the two existing parties to progressive social reform, agree with the Harrington realignment strategy of trying to make use of the Democratic Party as a tool to make room for radical change. These reform-optimistic socialists view the Sanders campaign as the beginning of a meaningful mass movement, the awakening of the Democratic Party&amp;#8217;s left wing, a step in the correct direction, or at least as a hopeful sign that &amp;#8220;socialist&amp;#8221; is losing its stigma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After criticizing Sanders for lacking a socialist class analysis and calling his foreign policy a &amp;#8220;complete disappointment,&amp;#8221; for example, a &lt;em&gt;Jacobin&lt;/em&gt; article concludes that these problematic positions are &amp;#8220;only a more urgent reason to become involved in the Sanders campaign and criticize it from the inside, as supporters&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/10/hillary-clinton-bernie-democratic-presidential-debate/"&gt;&amp;#8220;A Progressive or a Radical?&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by Mike Davis, October 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the primaries began in 2016 and Sanders proved his electability by remaining neck-and-neck with Clinton in polls, the tone of the socialist press predictably became less concerned with Sanders' inevitable loss and subsequent endorsement of Clinton (which no longer seems nearly as inevitable as it did six months ago), and it has become more concerned with defending Sanders against Clinton and the mainstream Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several such articles appeared in &lt;em&gt;Jacobin&lt;/em&gt; in January and February. In &lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/bernie-sanders-democratic-party-primary-president-iowa-caucus-new-hampshire-primary/"&gt;&amp;#8220;The War on Bernie Sanders,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; Matt Karp claims Sanders has proved &amp;#8220;that it is possible for an avowed socialist to participate successfully in national politics without altering his identity or renouncing his convictions.&amp;#8221; In &lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/bernie-sanders-socialist-democratic-primary-working-class/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Bernie and His Critics,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; Nivedita Majumdar dismisses criticisms from the left&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;such as &amp;#8220;Bernie is just a social democrat. He is not advocating socializing the means of production, nor is he seeking to dismantle the American empire&amp;#8221; (in other words, the basic socialist positions)&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;as &amp;#8220;unexceptional.&amp;#8221; She concludes that it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter what Sanders' positions are because &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s about the political moment the campaign has created and its possibilities.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To coincide with the beginning of primary season, Socialist Alternative has launched a pro-Sanders
&lt;a href="http://www.socialistalternative.org/2016/02/01/movement4bernie-takes-country/"&gt;#Movement4Bernie&lt;/a&gt; initiative to draw leftists to the Bernie movement and defend the Sanders campaign against the Democratic establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Sanders continues to match Clinton in elected delegates, the Democratic Party still has a weapon of last resort against populist candidates: the so-called superdelegates who are unelected, tend to support establishment candidates (one recent &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/02/18/467230964/survey-clinton-maintains-massive-superdelegate-lead"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; found 63% favor Clinton), and make up 20% of total delegates sent to the Democratic National Convention. If Sanders fails to keep up in the polls in the coming weeks, I expect the socialist dialog will center again on trying to leverage the interest he has generated in socialism while lamenting anew his choice of party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_post_mortem_february_2017"&gt;Post Mortem (February 2017)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 2016 primary season, Sanders' results at the polls and the amount of national attention he brought to the issue of wealth inequality continued to exceed my expectations. Although it wasn&amp;#8217;t enough to beat the superior organization and name-recognition of his opponent, his primary run alone was one of the most successful attempts to energize a latent left wing of the Democratic Party. At the Democratic National Convention in July, Hillary Clinton was nominated as the Democratic Party&amp;#8217;s candidate, no superdelegates required. Bernie received less than 40% of delegate votes (and about 43% of the popular vote). The gory details can be found in the Wikipedia entry for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016"&gt;Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one factor I completely underestimated was the stunning rise of Donald Trump. When I wrote this article a year ago I thought his campaign for the Republican nomination was a joke, much more so the idea that anybody could lose to him during a general election. Trump&amp;#8217;s surprise Republican nomination had something of a simultaneously accelerating and abortive effect on the usual dynamics between the Democratic Party and the grassroots movement it sought to absorb as both the party and its discontents turned their focus to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jill Stein &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/08/jill-stein-bernie-sanders-green-party"&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; to give Sanders the Green Party nomination so that he could continue his movement into the general election as a popular third-party candidate. But on July 12, Sanders followed through on his promise to &lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/13/bernie-sanders-why-i-endorsed-hillary-clinton-commentary.html"&gt;endorse&lt;/a&gt; Hillary Clinton. Then in September, against the threat of a Trump victory, he &lt;a href="http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/discouraging_protest_vote_sanders_says_elect_clintonthen_mobilize_20160918"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; his supporters to reconsider casting a third-party protest vote. Of course, when Hillary did manage to lose to Trump, many Democrats did what Democrats do: they found the most reasonable politician around and blamed him for their failures. After the election, &lt;em&gt;TIME&lt;/em&gt; published an editorial titled &lt;a href="http://time.com/4569766/bernie-sanders-ralph-nader-2016/http://time.com/4569766/bernie-sanders-ralph-nader-2016/"&gt;&amp;#8220;And the 2016 Ralph Nader Award Goes to&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203; Bernie Sanders.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of August, as disappointed Sanders supporters were trying to decide whether a vote for Hillary or a potentially-spoiling vote for a third-party was the greater evil, &lt;em&gt;Socialist Worker&lt;/em&gt; asked several leftist activists to comment on the aftermath of the Sanders campaign.
Author Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor provided the requisite leftist insight that what we need to do is &amp;#8220;build movements.&amp;#8221; Bhaskar Sunkara thought the best use of the residual Bernie energy was to &amp;#8220;organize independent political challenges at the local level, because we can actually, in many places, run viable, competitive campaigns for the City Council or for state Senate, and challenge the Democrats there.&amp;#8221; ISO member Jen Roesch thought that because a &amp;#8220;socialist&amp;#8221; came close to winning the Democratic nomination there is hope for mass movements to develop &amp;#8220;outside the electoral arena&amp;#8221; (but that we should also vote Jill Stein, just in case). Green Party gubernatorial candidate Howie Hawkins warned that &amp;#8220;the Democratic Party will be a graveyard for Sanders' demands&amp;#8221; and so supporting the Green Party is the next step for those who want to continue the &amp;#8220;political revoultion&amp;#8221; started by Sanders. (&lt;a href="https://socialistworker.org/2016/08/30/beyond-bernie-whats-next-for-the-left"&gt;&amp;#8220;Beyond Bernie: What&amp;#8217;s next for the left?&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; August 2016)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it is Bernie himself who has chosen the alley in the dead-end of electoral politics where his movement will be buried. On August 24, 2016, he launched a non-profit organization called &lt;a href="https://ourrevolution.com/about/"&gt;Our Revolution&lt;/a&gt; which &amp;#8220;will give the people a major voice in the political system by activating supporters,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;empower the next generation of progressive leaders by inspiring and recruiting progressive candidates to run for offices,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;educate the public about the most pressing issues confronting our nation.&amp;#8221; It will do all of that with the help of ten full-time staffers&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;it would have been more, but as Our Revolution was preparing to launch, &lt;a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/25/our_revolution_bernie_sanders_launches_new"&gt;over half of the staff quit in protest&lt;/a&gt; over concerns about leadership and lack of diversity. It&amp;#8217;s plain to see that both words in his organization&amp;#8217;s name are meaningless. The process Chris Hedges predicted exactly a year ago about the bones of Sanders' movement being &amp;#8220;fossilized into donor and volunteer lists&amp;#8221; is well under way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Harrington died of esophageal cancer in 1989, but not before he completed his final contribution to socialist thought. &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Socialism.html?id=zo91Keuw-cEC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socialism: Past and Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is still readable as a clear history and explanation of socialism (from a macro-economic or political view). The hopes he expresses in &lt;em&gt;Socialism&lt;/em&gt; for a &amp;#8220;visionary gradualism&amp;#8221; represent one of the most articulate cases for democratic socialism that I know of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Gindin&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/12/socialist-party-bernie-sanders-labor-capitalism/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Building a Mass Socialist Party&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Jacobin&lt;/em&gt;, December 2016) read to me as both an accurate assessment of the Sanders campaign and one of the more practical looks at the possibility of a future socialist movement in the USA and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Hall and Barry Grey&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/07/16/sand-j16.html"&gt;&amp;#8220;Is Bernie Sanders a socialist?&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;WSWS&lt;/em&gt;, 16 July 2015) contrasts Sanders' politics with several principles of socialism. As a comprehensive socialist rejection of Sanders, it is the most concise that I&amp;#8217;ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://theodysseyonline.com/appalachian-state/bernie-sanders-not-socialist/238167"&gt;&amp;#8220;Bernie Sanders Is Not A Socialist,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, 8 December 2015) Brett Heinz recounts some more history of social democracy to contextualize Bernie Sanders' positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For something more positive about both Sanders and his choice to run as a Democrat I recommend
Eric Lee&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.ericlee.info/blog/?p=1115"&gt;&amp;#8220;The Sanders Revolution&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; (and the other pro-Sanders articles on his weblog).&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#8220;the Reconstruction experiment in racial democracy failed because it began at the wrong end, emphasizing political means and civil rights acts rather than economic means and self-determination.&amp;#8221;

&lt;h2 id="_civil_war"&gt;Civil War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slavery is not very conducive to capitalism. Slave ownership is a large and fixed investment which is unsuitable to quickly changing industrial markets. During economic downturns it is less expensive to fire a worker than to sell a slave. And as industry expands, even the slave-owning agricultural sectors of an economy begin to conflict with the interests of capitalists. Slave owners hold a substantial portion of the labour force off of the labour market reducing competition for jobs and forcing capitalists to pay higher wages than would be the case if slaves' labour power were available on the market. What capitalists want is as much unemployed but available labour at their disposal as possible (without causing riots)&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;that, and labourers who are responsible for housing and feeding themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why at the rise of capitalism in Europe serfdom was abolished, the commons were enclosed to force the peasants off of their land (and their means of subsistence), and finally harsh vagrancy laws and forced-labour workhouses were established to coerce the first wage workers into the factories. And that is why, in the United States during the 19th century, the capitalist North increasingly came into conflict with the slave-owning South. Capitalists eventually waged a war which crushed the South&amp;#8217;s economy and made the slaves' labour power available to the labour market as free workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="title"&gt;Dyer D. Lum&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the early writers to give such an economic theory of the forces which lead to the American Civil War was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyer_Lum"&gt;Dyer Lum (1839 – 1893)&lt;/a&gt; who became an influential anarchist and labor activist toward the end of the 19th-century. Writing in 1886 he said of the capitalist North and the agrarian-slavery South, &amp;#8220;They were rival industrial systems which had met in the same path, and one must give way. The war followed.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Lum, eager to do his part in ending slavery, volunteered for and served the Union forces for three years. But upon observing the way the South was re-integrated into the union after the war in terms favorable to speculators, military contractors, and monopolists, he had second thoughts about the ultimate purpose of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To-day, South and North alike admit the fundamental principle of our industrial system, the corner stone of our economic structure: &lt;em&gt;Free labor is cheaper than slave labor!&lt;/em&gt; Employers without responsibilities could find new fields for enterprise when the system which entailed responsibilities was once removed. The South are converted; the poverty of a factory population is no longer an Eastern peculiarity. The gray meets blue in hearty union to draw dividends and cut coupons. They have found free labor the &lt;em&gt;cheapest&lt;/em&gt;. (88)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_mormon_wars"&gt;Mormon Wars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the Civil War had brought the South into alignment with the capitalist system of wage labour, Lum saw the Federal repression of the Mormons in Utah as an attempt to undo the cooperative-based economy the Mormons had established in order to expose them to the exploitation of the industrial East. It was for the expansion of capitalism, Lum wrote, &amp;#8220;that the cry has gone forth that the Mormon must go!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lum, who traveled to Utah as part of a congressional committee on labor issues, had a very high regard for Mormon society. In one of his booklets he wrote, &amp;#8220;The whole Mormon system, social, religious, industrial, is essentially based on two fundamental principles: &lt;em&gt;cooperation&lt;/em&gt; in business and &lt;em&gt;arbitration&lt;/em&gt; in disputes&amp;#8221; (which he contrasted to the mainstream American values of capitalism and civil litigation).&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote."&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; He was so enamored with their cooperative businesses that he viewed Utah as perhaps the most successful socialist country anywhere: &amp;#8220;The living question of the present is that stated in the preamble of the constitution of the Knights of Labor as &amp;#8216;the abolishment of the wage system,&amp;#8217; a problem the Mormon alone has solved.&amp;#8221; (86)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lum was writing at a time when the United States government was taking advantage of American bigotry toward Mormons and polygamy in order to pass legislation aimed at dismantling the Mormon society. The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmunds_Act"&gt;Edmunds Anti-Polygamy Act of 1882&lt;/a&gt; disenfranchised Mormons and put many of their leaders in jail while the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmunds%E2%80%93Tucker_Act"&gt;Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1887&lt;/a&gt; disincorporated the LDS Church, seized its property, and replaced Utah judges with federally-appointed judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the war against Mormons began before the Civil War. In the 1830s, not long after Joseph Smith founded his church, Mormons began settling in Missouri. They did not find many friends among their new neighbors. Not only were the Mormon immigrants vocally against slavery (in a slave-holding state), but they voted. At one polling place in 1838, around 200 non-Mormon Missourians gathered to prevent Mormons from voting. The Mormons asserted their rights, and a brawl broke out. The skirmish at the polls was the first violence in a series of minor armed conflicts and raids that took place between Mormons and Missourians known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1838_Mormon_War"&gt;1838 Mormon War&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 27, 1838, the governor of Missouri, Lilburn Boggs, issued Executive Order 44, which has become known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Executive_Order_44"&gt;Extermination Order&lt;/a&gt;. The order read in part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary for the public peace&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;their outrages are beyond all description.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="attribution"&gt;
&amp;#8212; From Boggs' Extermination Order
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mormons (around 10,000 of them) were expelled from Missouri and found refuge in Illinois (and then eventually in the Utah Territory). While they were chased out of Missouri for threatening the slave economy there, they were also nearly chased out of Utah for threatening the expansion of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1857-1858, President James Buchanan sent thousands of US troops to invade the Utah Territory in what has been called the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_War"&gt;Mormon War&lt;/a&gt;. The Nauvoo Legion, the Mormon&amp;#8217;s militia, activated and held the Federal troops at the border (in what is now Wyoming) where both armies made winter camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the Mormons knew that if the Federal troops were intent on entering Utah, they could not be held off for long. Brigham Young wanted to avoid any open fighting if possible. So in March of 1858 he began executing an evacuation plan. In northern Utah (including Salt Lake City), Mormons buried the foundation of the temple they were constructing, put kindling to their buildings, and as many as 30,000 fled southward leaving only enough men behind to set fire to everything in case the Army entered the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it became clear that the Mormons would rather burn their territory than give up their mode of living, a peace accord was reached with the federal government. The terms of the agreement allowed the Mormons to return to their homes and continue living unmolested, and in return Young was replaced as governor of the territory and the Army was allowed to enter and maintain a remote fort. Federal troops remained in Utah until they were withdrawn to fight the Civil War in 1862.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But against the renewed persecution of the 1880s, of which Lum and other American anarchists wrote, the Mormons were not as victorious. In 1890 the LDS Church capitulated and renounced polygamy; in 1896 Utah joined the Union as the 45th state and became increasingly integrated into the capitalist economy. The hierarchical structure of the Church fit well with capitalism and became a weapon against the more democratic elements of its priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church today owns significant for-profit (non-cooperative) property, including businesses which employ church members (who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; pay tithes). Some of the profits from church investments pay the salaries of the General Authorities (high-ranking leaders) who are themselves often property owners, executives, and/or well-paid professionals before accepting the church position. Meanwhile the rank-and-file members and third-world converts must work for a living. The church still inculcates mutual aid and relief societies (it is rare to find a truly destitute Mormon), but nobody today would mistake Utah for a great socialist country. In that sense it can be said that the Mormon War was eventually successful in defeating Mormonism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="_the_war_on_fundamentalist_mormonism"&gt;The War on Fundamentalist Mormonism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with Lum that the 19th-century Mormon economy in Utah was a barrier to Eastern capitalism, but I think Lum&amp;#8217;s account is overly optimistic, especially his claim that the Mormon cooperatives had managed to abolish wage labour. With the advantage of having the entire 20th century in hindsight, I&amp;#8217;d say the Mormon social experiment&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;which sought not the abolition of capital but the cooperation between the owning and working classes (including state ownership of some enterprises), strove for economic self-sufficiency, looked to a single almost supreme prophet for guidance, believed it was restoring ancient order to a decadent society, and cultivated a strong identity as a unified people in the face of external threats&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;shared some features of the Fascist movements which later arose out of radical unions in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the LDS Church is also built on principles which would be impossible to reconcile with anything like Fascism, especially its cosmopolitan missionary program by which the church since its inception has made friends and converts from nations and in countries all over the planet. But suppose the church stopped proselytizing: what would an insular Mormon church look like, especially if its authoritarian elements were emphasized? We don&amp;#8217;t have to imagine. The American West is dotted by isolated fundamentalist Mormon communities which split with (or were excommunicated by) the LDS Church beginning in the first years of the 20th century and have refused to this day to integrate into the mainstream society or economy. The largest organized group of fundamentalist Mormons is the  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-Day_Saints"&gt;&amp;#8220;Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; (FLDS) which is infamously characterized by authoritarian rulers, revered (or at least accepted) as prophets, who sexually abuse and economically exploit their subjects.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote."&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments have used the crimes of those leaders to punish and attempt to dissolve FLDS communes in order to integrate members into society at large as taxable worker-shoppers. A series of raids culminating in a large 1953 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Creek_raid"&gt;action against the town of Short Creek&lt;/a&gt; (which is today the twin towns of Colorado City and Hildale) carried out by Arizona state troopers and national guardsmen resulted in the arrest of 400 Mormon men, women, and children. Some children were never reunited with their families, and the fact that most of the families were allowed to return home was only because of the immense nation-wide public outrage at the raid and the way it was carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again in 2008, acting on a false report of sexual abuse made via telephone by a non-Mormon woman in a different state, militarized police &lt;a href="https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/texas-has-its-own-view-of-polygamists-the-texas-flds-raids-and-trials/"&gt;raided an FLDS compound in Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The police removed 462 children under the age of 18 and placed them in protective custody. The children were kept in custody for a month until an appeals court ordered that they be returned to their families. In 2012 the state of Texas initiated legal forfeiture and seizure proceedings against the ranch, a move reminiscent of the old Edmunds–Tucker Act, and in 2014 the State took physical possession of the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While fundamentalist Mormonism is not nearly as sympathetic as the Mormon society Dyer Lum knew and described, the retreat fundamentalist Mormons have made to insular authoritarianism is a direct result of the 19th-century campaign of state repression, a campaign which continues today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="_background_the_killing_of_michael_brown"&gt;Background: The Killing of Michael Brown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, none of the following facts are disputed. On August 9, 2014, Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson City Police Department confronted Michael Brown, 18, and his friend&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Dorian Johnson, 22, from his vehicle because they were walking in the middle of a residential street. The officer ordered them to move to the sidewalk. Instead of simply complying, Brown argued with the officer through the window of the police SUV. A scuffle ensued, Brown, who was unarmed, hit Wilson in the face with his hand, and according to Wilson&amp;#8217;s testimony, made a grab for the officer&amp;#8217;s firearm. In response, Wilson fired 2 shots at Brown who ran down the street for about 150 feet before turning around to face the officer (several witnesses reported he had turned around in surrender). Meanwhile Wilson had exited his vehicle and pursued on foot, firing at least 10 more times. Less than 90 seconds after initially contacting the jaywalker, Wilson had hit Brown with at least 6 bullets, including a fatal shot to his head.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote."&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grand jury was convened after the shooting, and it found the evidence to be insufficient to provide probable cause for bringing criminal charges against officer Wilson. He was never arrested in connection with the killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the shooting and the grand jury decision have been met with significant &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ferguson_unrest"&gt;social unrest in Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; and in cities around the country including protest marches, riots, looting, and destruction of retail storefront property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentiment behind some of the protesters' demands for &amp;#8220;justice for Mike Brown&amp;#8221; and the bewildered response of spectating Americans trying to make sense of why the black residents of Ferguson (sometimes shortened to &amp;#8220;thugs&amp;#8221; for convenience) would destroy &amp;#8220;their own&amp;#8221; neighborhoods both reveal something of the mystified nature of capitalism and the myths which sustain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Marxists use Engels' term &amp;#8216;false consciousness&amp;#8217; to describe beliefs about the world which obfuscate its actual workings and mislead people into accepting the current social structures as &amp;#8220;natural&amp;#8221; or even inevitable. And it was Karl Marx, an often unemployed theorist living under industrial capitalism, who taught us the importance of the economic basis to understanding the nature, ends, and ideologies of the dominate political structures in all times and places. But it was Jesus of Nazareth, a propertyless Jewish peasant subsisting under imperial Rome, who taught us how to see and see through the moral judgments which flow from such false consciousness, a morality which serves to protect and create the exploiting classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the sayings of Jesus which have been preserved, there are a handful of colorful and memorable quips employing exaggerated contrasts to illustrate the hypocritical judgments made by the dominant political and religious ideologies and leaders of his time. One of the most famous is his rhetorical question to those who fixate on the speck of sawdust in their brother&amp;#8217;s eye, but don&amp;#8217;t even notice the log sticking out of their own eye.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote."&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Another is, &amp;#8220;You blind leaders! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote."&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Jesus' sayings help to reveal, although it is counterintuitive, is that the most successful and stubborn ideas which make up a false consciousness do not operate on subtle misconceptions or minor deceptions. They are always complete reversals resulting in total hypocrisies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' cynicism can be applied generally to see how the hypocrisy is borne out today (and a few specific examples of such reversals from Ferguson will be demonstrated in the next sections). Every stable mode of production has its own obfuscating myths which are accepted by a sufficient number of both the exploiting and exploited classes to maintain widespread complacency. And so in liberalism we can expect to find those myths which hide the horrors of capitalism from the citizens of republics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Property, a ruthless process and legal institution which deprives millions of property, requiring armies of police and soldiers to maintain, is seen as a provider of prosperity and stability. The Rule of Law, which so impartially allows the rich and the starving poor to depend on the purchase of commodities for survival, is seen as an egalitarian force. Above all Progressivism&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;by which the current social organization is seen to be fundamentally good and always improving through the democratic mechanisms of elections, petition, and scientific enlightenment&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;condemns as criminal any attempt by the oppressed to assert their dignity or make actual improvements to their conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="__justice_for_mike_brown"&gt;&amp;#8216;Justice for Mike Brown&amp;#8217;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the death of Michael Brown: arming oneself then confronting, fighting with, pursuing, and finally shooting to death an unarmed young man is behavior which should require significant extenuating circumstances to excuse. Even if Wilson were not a police officer, his actions would likely warrant a criminal trial to determine the facts more fully. But Wilson &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a police officer who has been entrusted by the public (whom he is ostensibly protecting) with weapons, training, and legal authority. If anything, while acknowledging his work will tend to place him into conflicts, he should be held to a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; standard of behavior and legal culpability than an ordinary citizen in handling those confrontations. Instead, in accordance with the law, he has been granted extra leniency and the case against him will not even be examined in open court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all of that, &lt;em&gt;and not even considering pre-existing systemic injustices or the patterns of police abuse&lt;/em&gt;, it is plain why there is such widespread belief that an injustice was committed against Michael Brown. &amp;#8216;Justice for Mike Brown&amp;#8217; has become a slogan for protests, and is taken as a demand by journalists looking to provide a motive for protesters. But what would such &amp;#8216;justice&amp;#8217; look like? All too often the slogan is simply a demand that Darren Wilson be more fully subjected to the same criminal justice system which produced him. In such cases it is actually a demand of &amp;#8216;justice for Darren Wilson&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a demand that reveals two divergent but both conservative reactions. The first, the &amp;#8216;peaceful protesters,&amp;#8217; believe the justice system provides its own adequate channels of reform and view protest, insofar as it is legal or at least peaceful, as legitimate democratic petition of the government. The second, sharing the logic of a lynch mob, believes itself to be an extralegal corrective to a justice system gone so far astray that its own means of reform are no longer effective. Both accept at face value the necessity of the justice system as it promises to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of the riotous nights following the grand jury decision, CNN described a crowd of protesters who overturned and burned a police cruiser and then chanted across the street toward the lines of riot police and national guardsmen, &amp;#8220;We are not your enemy. We just want justice.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_5" title="View footnote."&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; The demand for justice, referring to criminal justice, shows how fully even some of the vandalizing protesters in Ferguson have internalized the liberal myths which legitimate capitalism and its political superstructures. Except to the grieving friends and family of Michael Brown who can&amp;#8217;t be blamed for seeking whatever peace and closure they can find from a legal system which purports to provide it, the question of justice in the case of Darren Wilson is a symptom, a speck of dust, a gnat. Yet the Ferguson community leaders and many protesters strain at him while swallowing the murderous political system they believe can bring them justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vandalism, even in the cause of liberalism, is clearly seen as a threat to the authorities and the image of control they&amp;#8217;d like to maintain (hence the frenzied calls for peace among political leaders at all levels). But the split between the strictly peaceful and the extra-legal protesters also provides an opportunity to control the scope of debate during times of social unrest. For example, note what the highest ranking office of liberalism in the world has to say about rioting. During the 1992 LA Riots, President Bush acknowledged that while Americans have reason to be frustrated with the law, they should not actually unleash those frustrations on the legal system itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;In this highly controversial court case, a verdict was handed down by a California jury. To Americans of all races who were shocked by the verdict, let me say this: You must understand that our system of justice provides for the peaceful, orderly means of addressing this frustration. We must respect the process of law whether or not we agree with the outcome. There&amp;#8217;s a difference between frustration with the law and direct assaults upon our legal system.&amp;#8221; &lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_6" title="View footnote."&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="attribution"&gt;
&amp;#8212; George Bush
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, president Obama in his address to the nation after the Ferguson grand jury decision pleaded for frustrations to be channeled &amp;#8220;constructively&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;First and foremost, we are a nation built on the rule of law.  And so we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury&amp;#8217;s to make. [&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;] But what is also true is that there are still problems and communities of color aren&amp;#8217;t just making these problems up. [&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;]  What we need to do is to understand them and figure out how do we make more progress. [&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;] That won&amp;#8217;t be done by throwing bottles. That won&amp;#8217;t be done by smashing car windows. [&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;] So, to those in Ferguson, there are ways of channeling your concerns constructively and there are ways of channeling your concerns destructively.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_7" title="View footnote."&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="attribution"&gt;
&amp;#8212; Barack Obama
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riots provide several benefits for the working class at the expense of the owning class. As such, there is an ideological benefit in dissuading those who can be persuaded by liberalism from rioting. The liberal kit outlined by Obama&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;foundation on a Rule of Law, Progress, the sanctity of Property, and proper Democratic channels&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;is so ingrained in the minds of Americans that such appeals may work at an almost instinctive level. But even if they are ineffective in that, appeals to the law serve at least two important roles in maintaining order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="olist arabic"&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By constantly making a distinction between lawful and non-lawful protest, the debate becomes centered on the morality and efficacy of extralegal reform. This has the effect of pushing radical change to the periphery, and completely out of view of most protesters and spectators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By creating a sense of urgency in maintaining peaceful protests, politicians can induce protesters to police each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A darker theoretical speculation can be drawn about the role of murderous policing itself, including the double-standard seen in the indictment process. By deviating so obviously from the promise of justice the system purports, prosecutors and police have succeeded in prompting people to take to the streets in &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; of the criminal justice system. How convenient for the propertied classes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_why_are_they_looting_their_own_neighborhoods"&gt;Why Are They Looting Their Own Neighborhoods?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, much of the American populace suffers from a similar but different aspect of the liberal mystification. They read the reports of looting and see the pictures on TV of shops on fire, and they just can&amp;#8217;t seem to figure out why those black people would destroy &amp;#8220;their own&amp;#8221; neighborhoods. As if the shopping centers in any American neighborhood, much less a black neighborhood, are collectively-owned cooperatives or in any way belong to the community rather than to petite bourgeois owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Americans are so ensconced in liberal mythology that they are utterly unable to make sense of the world that confronts them on their cable news programs every night. It seems perfectly natural to think of people&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;especially the dark skinned and uneducated&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;as commodities who should spend their lives working and obeying (or begging and obeying), but any disruption of peace and order is a startling transgression. &amp;#8216;Peace and order&amp;#8217; is paramount; it implies the ability to peaceably and orderly employ, tax, fine, and blame the poor&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203; in Ferguson and everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is with gnats and camels, so it is with looting and capital. Businesses have stolen more from the working class&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;and most extensively from the black working class&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;than any practical amount of looting could ever recover. Yet the political leaders, news journalists, and the average American worker will strain all of their moral indignation at the tiny acts of re-appropriation like when a looter makes off with food or a television, but will swallow without question the entire impoverishing, alienating system of wage work which leaves so many with so little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wealth of the United States of America, from a British colony to an imperialist superpower, is the result of over four centuries of indentured servitude, chattel slavery, genocide, debt peonage, subjugation of women, plundering wars, and a system of wage labour which has no end in sight, all legally sanctioned and enforced by the established police forces. And what Americans cannot understand, the thing that is beyond acceptance, is when a liquor store is looted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_the_virtue_of_rioting"&gt;The Virtue of Rioting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not all events that occur during times of rebellion are necessarily good. There is nothing useful or dignifying in opportunistic violence against individuals or theft of personal property committed under cover of social unrest, and such acts are properly crimes. It is also important to recognize that spontaneous uprisings like Ferguson are not organized revolutions in which targets are prioritized, goods are seized and distributed according to need, and capital is taken over to be run collectively&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;or whatever revolution might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as some of us may wish to see such activity, and while some spontaneous rebellions have historically lead to more directed revolutionary efforts, it is not even possible without more preparations than currently exist. The national guard in Missouri is happy to guard only the highest value centers of capital during a couple of nights of light looting of consumer goods. But if any protesters had attempted to actually take control of and operate their own workplaces, it would have been SWAT raids, live rounds, and whatever carnage was deemed necessary to return property to its lawfully exploiting owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why loot and riot at all? Earlier in this essay I claimed that riots provide benefits to the working class. What are they? Most obvious is the material benefits inherent in the act of looting. In addition to material gain, looting brings a flavour of what a post-capitalist economy will feel like. On every other day of their life, a looter&amp;#8217;s needs rule over them in the form of money and commodities. For a few brief days during a riot, commodities are subordinated to the form of mere goods which satisfy needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, riots are helpful because riots win political concessions. They signal to the ruling class that it is squeezing a tad tightly and needs to let up in order to keep its grip. The unrest in Ferguson has directly prompted the federal government to begin investigating the Ferguson Police Department for possible civil rights abuses,&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_8" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_8" title="View footnote."&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; and President Obama has asked congress for $75 million to fund 50,000 body cameras to help reduce murder and other abuse by America&amp;#8217;s police officers.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_9" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_9" title="View footnote."&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Other reforms may follow, none of which would have happened if protesters in Ferguson and elsewhere had not forced the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, riots and the reactions to riots reveal the hypocrisy Jesus saw so clearly. The public judgment of rioters lays bare the false morality of the dominate ideology. Covert domination&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;including economic exploitation and racism&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;can be swallowed and transmitted to new generations without being noticed. But overt domination is noticed and generates its own resistance. It is when domination is exposed and individuals are freed of their false consciousness that Jesus' &amp;#8220;kingdom of heaven,&amp;#8221; the Wobblies' &amp;#8220;new world in the shell of the old,&amp;#8221; and the Marxist&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;whithering away&amp;#8221; of classes is possible. There are Christians who don&amp;#8217;t understand a word of what Jesus said, but who nevertheless believe with all of their strength that his words have the power to save their souls. I don&amp;#8217;t think they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="_kitchen_v_herbert"&gt;Kitchen v. Herbert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The State&amp;#8217;s prohibition of the Plaintiffs' right to choose a same-sex marriage partner renders their fundamental right to marry as meaningless as if the State recognized the Plaintiffs' right to bear arms but not their right to buy bullets.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="attribution"&gt;
&amp;#8212; Judge Robert Shelby&lt;br&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Kitchen v. Herbert&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 10 was the 47th anniversary of the date &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v.\_Virginia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loving v. Virginia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;em&gt;Loving&lt;/em&gt; was the landmark case which found miscegenation laws (those laws which prohibited interracial marriages) to be unconstitutional. April 10 also happened to be the date the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_v._Herbert"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kitchen v. Herbert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote."&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; the case challenging Utah&amp;#8217;s constitutional prohibition of same-sex marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 66% of Utah&amp;#8217;s voters approved &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Constitutional_Amendment_3"&gt;Amendment 3&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. The amendment defines marriage as consisting &amp;#8220;only of the legal union between a man and a woman,&amp;#8221; as a preemptive measure to defend the state&amp;#8217;s marriage statutes against constitutional challenge. On December 20, 2013, a Federal District Court ruled in &lt;em&gt;Kitchen&lt;/em&gt; that the amendment violated the rights to due process and equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, on a rational basis alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the conclusion of his ruling, Judge Robert Shelby found the state&amp;#8217;s contentions in &lt;em&gt;Loving&lt;/em&gt; to be &amp;#8220;almost identical to the assertions made by the State of Utah in support of Utah&amp;#8217;s laws prohibiting same-sex marriage.&amp;#8221; He found those assertions to be unconvincing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-miscegenation laws in Virginia and elsewhere were designed to, and did, deprive a targeted minority of the full measure of human dignity and liberty by denying them the freedom to marry the partner of their choice. Utah&amp;#8217;s Amendment 3 achieves the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than protecting or supporting the families of opposite-sex couples, Amendment 3 perpetuates inequality by holding that the families and relationships of same-sex couples are not now, nor ever will be, worthy of recognition. Amendment 3 does not thereby elevate the status of opposite-sex marriage; it merely demeans the dignity of same-sex couples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="line-through"&gt;Judge Shelby&amp;#8217;s ruling was appealed, and the parties are currently waiting on the Tenth Circuit Court in Denver to make a decision. If it is appealed again, there is a chance that the case will be selected to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court which could finally establish some national precedent on the matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Shelby&amp;#8217;s ruling was appealed, providing an opportunity for the Tenth Circuit Court in Denver to consider the validity of marriage bans for the first time. That court found the appellants' justifications to fail the strict scrutiny test, affirming the district court&amp;#8217;s ruling &amp;#8220;that Amendment 3 and similar statutory enactments do not withstand constitutional scrutiny.&amp;#8221; In October, the Supreme Court denied without comment the writ of certiorari leaving the appellate court&amp;#8217;s mandate in effect: same-sex marriages are valid and must be recognized in the State of Utah. (On June 26, 2015, in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obergefell v. Hodges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court found it to be unconstitutional to deny marriages to same-sex couples making such marriages available and recognized throughout the union.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal analogies between interracial couples' right to marry and same-sex couples' right to marry have been made almost since the Supreme Court ruled on &lt;em&gt;Loving&lt;/em&gt; in 1967. In her celebrated and comprehensive history of miscegenation law, &lt;em&gt;What Comes Naturally&lt;/em&gt;, Peggy Pascoe mentioned such an analogy being dismissed by the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1971. It wasn&amp;#8217;t until a ruling by the Hawaii Supreme Court in 1993 that courts began taking the same-sex analogy to &lt;em&gt;Loving&lt;/em&gt; seriously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;After the Hawaii ruling, both the energy of the campaign to legalize same-sex marriage and the number of court cases that accompanied it grew by leaps and bounds. Over the next decade, several judges issued rulings overturning state bans, and they used the parallel to &lt;em&gt;Loving v. Virginia&lt;/em&gt; to do so.&amp;#8221; (299-300)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an essay she wrote for &lt;em&gt;History News Network&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://hnn.us/article/4708"&gt;Why the Ugly Rhetoric Against Gay Marriage Is Familiar to this Historian of Miscegenation,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; Pascoe argued that in order to understand the current debate over same-sex marriage it is first necessary to understand the history of American miscegenation laws, &amp;#8220;because both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage come to this debate, knowing or unknowingly, wielding rhetorical tools forged during the history of miscegenation law.&amp;#8221; She also noted that, &amp;#8220;The arguments white supremacists used to justify for miscegenation laws&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;that interracial marriages were contrary to God&amp;#8217;s will or somehow unnatural&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;are echoed today by the most conservative opponents of same-sex marriage.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_heteronormativity_for_time_and_all_eternity"&gt;Heteronormativity for Time and All Eternity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed the opponents of same-sex marriage are almost invariably religious and motivated by an adherence to what they believe to be divine revelations and/or a philosophy of natural law. In the &lt;em&gt;Kitchen&lt;/em&gt; appeal, a coalition of Christian churches filed a 42-page amicus brief in support of the state.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote."&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; The brief represents something of an ecumenical wonder, bringing together in the battle against same-sex marriage the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the National Association of Evangelicals, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Southern Baptist Convention, and the Lutheran Church&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;Missouri Synod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently if there is anything Catholics, Mormons, Evangelicals, Lutherans, and Southern Baptists all agree on, it is that the sexes of would-be spouses are important and should be regulated by the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) appears to have the strongest motivation to preserve a traditional definition of marriage in Utah. Not only because of that church&amp;#8217;s deep ties to Utah, but also because family occupies an unusually important position in Mormon thought. Unlike other Christian sects who marry &amp;#8220;until death do us part,&amp;#8221; Mormon couples partake in an ordinance of &amp;#8220;celestial marriage&amp;#8221; in which they are sealed during a temple ceremony &amp;#8220;for time and eternity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Mormons, family is not merely the fundamental unit of society here on earth. It is also an everlasting institution, a cosmic matrix underlying the very purpose of life and eternal progression: we were spirit children of Heavenly Father and Mother in our pre-earth existence; we gain physical bodies, faith, and families in this, our mortal life; after physical death, our bodies and families will be raised into exalted existence, like God was in his body, at the time of the resurrection to progress evermore and perhaps begin the cycle anew.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote."&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the LDS First Presidency released a statement reaffirming the importance of the family and emphasizing that marriage is between a man and a woman (&amp;#8220;The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan&amp;#8221;). That statement, titled &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation"&gt;The Family: A Proclamation to the World&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;, is cited on page 10 of the amicus brief filed in the &lt;em&gt;Kitchen&lt;/em&gt; appeal to demonstrate, strangely enough, that for Mormons &amp;#8220;homosexuality is remote from teachings about marriage and family&amp;#8221; in order to argue against &amp;#8220;the suggestion that religious support for husband-wife marriage is rooted in anti-homosexual animus.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church&amp;#8217;s interest in the state definition and regulation of marriage may be explained by a fear expressed succinctly on page 19 of the religious brief: &amp;#8220;if the meaning of marriage is changed in concept, the cultural significance attached to marriage will also change in practice.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_freedoms_and_restrictions_in_the_history_of_mormon_marriage"&gt;Freedoms and Restrictions in the History of Mormon Marriage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a time when the Mormons were condemned for having too liberal a view of marriage and family. In nineteenth-century Utah &amp;#8220;celestial marriage&amp;#8221; was a euphemism for &amp;#8220;plural marriage,&amp;#8221; a practice in which some Mormon men would take multiple wives. At that time, plural marriage was taught as being essential to eternal progression, just as opposite-sex marriage is proclaimed by the Church to be essential today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1866 Brigham Young, the second president of the LDS Church and himself a great fan of the doctrine of plural marriage, delivered a brief defense of polygamy in which he stated, &amp;#8220;The only men who become gods, even the Sons of God, are those who enter into polygamy.&amp;#8221; In that same sermon, Young declared that if Utah was not admitted as a state to the union until it outlawed polygamy &amp;#8220;then, we shall never be admitted.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8288;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_5" title="View footnote."&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with increasing social pressure and ruinous repression by the federal government (particularly the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmunds%E2%80%93Tucker_Act"&gt;Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1887&lt;/a&gt;), the Church leaders' courageous defiance was set aside in favor of practicality. In 1890 Wilford Woodruff, the fourth president of the Church, after claiming to have received a revelation from Jesus Christ on the matter, issued &lt;a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng#"&gt;&amp;#8216;The Manifesto&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; which ended the practice of plural marriage by the Church. Utah was admitted as the 45th U.S. state a little over five years after the manifesto was issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the LDS Church experimented with marriage freedoms in the number of wives, it also historically restricted freedoms based on race. From the presidency of Brigham Young until 1978, the Church did not ordain black men to its priesthood or allow black members to participate in temple sealing ordinances&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;blacks were excluded from celestial marriage and the postmortal exaltation for which it is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Mormons combined contemporary justifications for slavery and apartheid, such as the theory that black skin was a divine curse marking out the descendants of Cain, with their own doctrine of premortal existence and agency to develop an especially vicious justification for racism: blacks were to be disenfranchised, and it was their own fault by their own choosing.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_6" title="View footnote."&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church&amp;#8217;s race realism, while tenuously implementable in the United States, was completely useless when the Church began proselytizing in ethnically mixed populations such as in Brazil. This practical difficulty combined with increasing political pressure since the Civil Rights Movement forced the Church to abandon its racist policies. In June 1978, the Church leadership received a revelation which removed the racial restrictions on priesthood membership and access to the temple including celestial marriage&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;over ten years after &lt;em&gt;Loving v. Virginia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_7" title="View footnote."&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their efforts to exclude same-sex couples from both celestial and mortal marriage (the 1995 Proclamation, California&amp;#8217;s Proposition 8, Utah&amp;#8217;s Amendment 3, etc.), the men who lead the LDS Church today seem determined to continue the Mormon tradition of teaching divine principles of marriage which it is later forced to rescind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were a Mormon, the thing that would frustrate me the most is how completely unnecessary the emphasis on heteronormative marriage is to the doctrine of celestial marriage. It would be much less painful (and more consistent with the Church&amp;#8217;s pro-family rhetoric) to make room in the Celestial Kingdom for same-sex families than it is to kick against the goads of a changing culture. It is embarrassing for an organization lead by purported prophets, seers, and revelators to repeatedly exhibit such shortsightedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Western politics, bare life has the peculiar privilege of being that whose exclusion founds the city of men.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="attribution"&gt;
&amp;#8212; Giorgio Agamben&lt;br&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Homo Sacer&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homer sacer&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;#8220;the accursed/sacred man&amp;#8221;) is an obscure figure from ancient Roman law whom anyone can kill without committing a crime, but who may not be sacrificed: an outlaw. &lt;em&gt;Homo sacer&lt;/em&gt; thus inhabits the threshold of the political realm by being included within the law only by being abandoned by both profane and divine law. In his extensive study of this archaic figure, the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben sees remnants of the original foundation of the Western political sphere in which political life (Aristotle&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;bios&lt;/em&gt;) is constituted by excluding the &amp;#8216;bare life&amp;#8217; (&lt;em&gt;zoe&lt;/em&gt;) of the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other limit of the political sphere is the mirrored figure of &lt;em&gt;homo sacer&lt;/em&gt;: the sovereign whose inclusion in the law consists of the exclusive ability to suspend the law by declaring a state of emergency (the &amp;#8220;sovereign exception&amp;#8221;). Insofar as subjects are exposed to legal homicide (such as extra-judicial executions) under the state of exception, sovereign power produces bare life. &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;The sovereign sphere is the sphere in which it is permitted to kill without committing homicide and without celebrating a sacrifice, and sacred life&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;that is, life that may be killed but not sacrificed&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;is the life that has been captured in this sphere.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; (83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;em&gt;Citizens Without Shelter&lt;/em&gt;, Leonard Feldman presents a theory in which the homeless body is seen as an example of &lt;em&gt;homo sacer&lt;/em&gt;. Through readings of U.S. case law on anti-homeless ordinances (those municipal codes which forbid begging, public feeding, sitting on sidewalks, sleeping outdoors, etc.) he shows that the courts have constructed homeless life as bare life. The homeless life, even when lived in the very center of the city, is included by the law only through its exclusion from political life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeless life shares similar ambivalence as the sacred life of &lt;em&gt;homo sacer&lt;/em&gt;: private and public, disgust and august, reviled and romanticized, criminal and victim, excluded and included. In recognizing homeless life as sacred life, Feldman has done well in following Agamben&amp;#8217;s directive: &amp;#8220;We must learn to recognize this structure of the ban in the political relations and public spaces in which we still live. &lt;em&gt;In the city, the banishment of sacred life is more internal than every internality and more external than every extraneousness.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (111)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even anti-authoritarian or pacifist utopians might concede the benefit of a professional peacekeeping organization whose members, authorized in the use of violence, are dedicated to defending victims and seeking out and providing comfort to the hurting. But in the parlance of actually existing cities, &amp;#8216;peace officer&amp;#8217; is synonymous with &amp;#8216;police officer,&amp;#8217; who is often dedicated to enforcing the interests of the strong against the weak and to making cities into safe, clean spaces for &lt;em&gt;bios&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;for capitalists and their worker-shoppers&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;by excluding bare life (and relegating the activities of bare life as much as possible to the sphere of the home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the production of homeless life within the cities of global capitalism can be seen as an instance of (or at least an approximation to) the production of bare life by sovereign power, then the sovereign counterpart to the sacred life of the homeless is the professional policeman (who shares the same, if mirrored, ambivalences as the homeless: respected and reviled, defender and criminal, public and private, human and animal, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a quotable line from his &lt;em&gt;Homage to Catalonia&lt;/em&gt;, George Orwell emphasized the role professional police play in maintaining property and class relations when he called the policeman the &amp;#8220;natural enemy&amp;#8221; of the worker. But a more diametric contrast would be between the policeman and the unemployed [non]worker: those unwilling or unable (or just too unlucky) to fit into capitalist society, including the ill and homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In downtowns throughout the world, the homeless beg outside of skyscrapers which are guarded by police and full of financial workers allocating and reinvesting immense concentrations of wealth. Visible on these homeless bodies, refugees with no camp (or whose camp is the streets in the business district of the city), living without homes in the hearts of cities which have banned homeless life, is not only the ancient foundation of political life itself but also the extreme contradictions which characterize life under global capitalism today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactions between the police and the homeless sometimes show the relation between homeless life and sacred life as more than mere approximation. When the police kill the homeless, they often do so with impunity. Below, I highlight four recent examples of police in the United States needlessly killing homeless men in plain sight of the public and video cameras. In all four cases it is undisputed that the police directly ended the life of the victim, and in three cases the state (local) jurisdiction determined that no crime was committed while carrying out the killing (in the other case, it was a jury which made that determination). Each of the cases reached national attention in part due to street protests following the announcements that officers would not be charged with criminal homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some of the cases below, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are still conducting their own review of the incidents. Even if those investigations reveal violations of constitutional or federal law, however, it seems unlikely that the individual police officers who carried out the killings will be indicted for homicide by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the footnotes I provide at least one link to video of each incident. Most of these videos, and other videos of each incident, are available from several locations on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_marvin_booker"&gt;Marvin Booker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 9, 2010, five Denver Sheriff&amp;#8217;s deputies held, beat, and shocked Marvin Booker to death in the waiting area of Denver&amp;#8217;s Van Cise-Simonet Detention Center. Booker, a 56-year-old homeless street preacher, was being held on charges of possession of drug paraphernalia. The incident was witnessed by tens of people and captured on several surveillance cameras.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as sacred life is excluded from legal sanctions against homicide, &amp;#8220;The coroner ruled that Booker&amp;#8217;s death was caused by homicide, meaning he died at the hands of others. But the deputies were cleared by a criminal investigation which found they had not broken any laws.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote."&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the FBI announced that it would investigate the slaying, but it&amp;#8217;s been two years and no report has been released yet.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote."&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; In November, 2014, a federal civil suit found the deputies to have used excessive force. The City of Denver paid a record $6 million to Booker&amp;#8217;s family.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote."&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_kelly_thomas"&gt;Kelly Thomas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 5, 2011, officers in Fullerton, California, confronted Kelly Thomas, an unarmed homeless man whom they incorrectly suspected of breaking into cars. Thomas became impatient with the policemen&amp;#8217;s questions and did not immediately comply with all of their demands. A digital recording device carried by the police captured one of the officers, Manny Ramos, calmly make the following statement to Thomas after putting on some white latex gloves, &amp;#8220;You see my fists? They are getting ready to fuck you up.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_5" title="View footnote."&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two officers then began striking Thomas with their batons and tackled him to the ground. Once on the ground, backup officers arrived who helped to restrain, shock, and beat him. Thomas began apologizing repeatedly, complained he couldn&amp;#8217;t breathe, called for help, begged for mercy, screamed in pain, and cried out &amp;#8220;Dad! Help me, Dad! They&amp;#8217;re killing me, Dad&amp;#8221; before losing consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When paramedics arrived, they were directed to treat an officer&amp;#8217;s minor injury while Thomas lay dying in his own blood on the street.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_6" title="View footnote."&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; In the eyes of the police officers at the scene, the bare, biological life of Kelly Thomas was excluded not only from the protections of law, but from also from medicine. Five days after the beating, Thomas was removed from life support and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unusual element of this case is that (after significant public protest) three of the six officers involved were actually charged with crimes: officer Ramos was charged with murder in the second degree, and the other two officers were charged with involuntary manslaughter. A jury found the first two officers (including Ramos) not guilty, and the charges against the third officer were dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Fullerton agreed to pay Thomas' mother $1 million in order to avoid civil litigation.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_7" title="View footnote."&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_milton_hall"&gt;Milton Hall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the morning of July 1, 2012, members of the Saginaw Police Department in Michigan responded in force to an aggressive man suspected of stealing a cup of coffee and being impolite to the owner of a convenience store.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_8" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_8" title="View footnote."&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; The police confronted Milton Hall, a 49-year-old black man, in a parking lot. Hall was armed with a three-inch folding pocket knife&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;hardly a deadly weapon. The confrontation was witnessed by passing motorists and captured on video by both police dashboard cameras and a witness&amp;#8217;s cellphone camera.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_9" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_9" title="View footnote."&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dashboard cam videos were shown during a news conference and are available on the MLive website.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_10" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_10" title="View footnote."&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; The videos show that eight police officers (including a K9 unit) formed a semi-circle around Hall. Six of the officers had firearms, both pistols and rifles, trained on Hall who was squatting in a defensive position with the small knife in his hand. At one point, the K9 handler backed up, apparently deciding not to sic the dog on Hall. In response, Hall seemed to relax, took a few steps backward and then two steps to his right. But when Hall appeared to take a step back toward the police line, all six officers opened fire, discharging 46 rounds in a few seconds and killing Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video obtained and broadcast by CNN was captured by a witness across the street and shows the incident from a different angle and with audio.&lt;sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_cnn2"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_11" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_11" title="View footnote."&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation by the Saginaw County Prosecutor&amp;#8217;s Office and the Michigan State Police into whether the shooting was justified concluded that &amp;#8220;Criminal charges aren&amp;#8217;t warranted.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_12" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_12" title="View footnote."&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; The Department of Justice and the FBI then conducted their own investigation and likewise determined that &amp;#8220;this tragic event does not present sufficient evidence of willful misconduct to lead to a federal criminal prosecution of the police officers involved.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_13" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_13" title="View footnote."&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton Hall&amp;#8217;s mother, Jewel Hall, described the shooting as &amp;#8220;a firing squad dressed in police uniforms.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnoteref"&gt;[&lt;a class="footnote" href="#_footnote_11" title="View footnote."&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; It is worth noting, however, that while the police presented themselves to Milton Hall as executioners and ended his life with an extreme degree of overkill reminiscent of a firing squad, the killing was not carried out according to any legal ritual or due process. Like &lt;em&gt;homo sacer&lt;/em&gt;, Milton Hall&amp;#8217;s homeless life was exposed to death by being excluded from both legal prohibitions against homicide and from sacrificial rites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_james_m_boyd"&gt;James M. Boyd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewel Hall is a retired public school teacher and community organizer in the Albuquerque, NM, area. In a tragic coincidence, at the time her son was killed by police in Saginaw, she was working to get the federal government to investigate an alarming pattern of shootings and use of force by the Albuquerque Police Department. In 2011 she wrote an opinion piece for the &lt;em&gt;Albuquerque Journal&lt;/em&gt; urging &amp;#8220;a full investigation by the Department of Justice.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8288;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_14" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_14" title="View footnote."&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; A year and a half after her son&amp;#8217;s death, a similar shooting unfolded on the outskirts of her hometown in which police with a K9 unit shot an uncooperative homeless man to death.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_15" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_15" title="View footnote."&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 26, 2014, members of the Albuquerque Police Department (APD) approached and attempted to frisk 38-year-old James M. Boyd based on the suspicion that he was camping without a permit in the Sandia foothills just east of town&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;he was suspected, in other words, of getting his &lt;em&gt;zoe&lt;/em&gt; all mixed up with the city&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;bios&lt;/em&gt;. Boyd, who was homeless with no private place where he could legally sleep, refused to cooperate. The situation escalated into an hours-long standoff including a tactical team and a State Police liaison. Home video aired by KRQE News 12 shows six regular uniformed officers holding Boyd at gunpoint even before the APD Crisis Intervention Team arrived.&lt;sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_krqe1"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_16" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_16" title="View footnote."&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyd remained defiant. He armed himself with two small knives, and at one point he warned the officers that &amp;#8220;I would have the right to kill you right now because you&amp;#8217;re trying to take me over. Don&amp;#8217;t get stupid with me.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8288;&lt;sup class="footnoteref"&gt;[&lt;a class="footnote" href="#_footnote_16" title="View footnote."&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The APD has released video footage from the helmet camera of one of the officers on scene which clearly shows how the standoff came to an end.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_17" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_17" title="View footnote."&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Boyd, who had apparently had enough of the negotiations, began gathering up his belongings to leave the scene. One of the officers called out, &amp;#8220;Do it!&amp;#8221; and a flashbang grenade detonated a few feet in front of Boyd. Simultaneously a dog was released which appeared to bite Boyd&amp;#8217;s hand, and both the dog&amp;#8217;s handler and an officer with a rifle moved toward him. Boyd dropped his bags and put his arms up to his side (while still holding at least one knife.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyd then turned to walk away, which is when two officers with rifles fired six live rounds at his back, striking him at least once. Boyd fell forward to the ground. Mortally wounded and lying prone, he was apparently unable to move his hands. The officers demanded that he drop the knife that was still clutched in his left hand. Boyd replied, &amp;#8220;Please don&amp;#8217;t hurt me. I can&amp;#8217;t move.&amp;#8221; Instead of moving to render aid, officers repeatedly ordered him to drop the knife while firing three beanbag rounds into his back from a shotgun. After some deliberation, officers then released the dog a second time. Boyd was unresponsive as the dog chewed at and pulled on his leg. Officers finally moved in, stepped on one of his hands, removed the knife from his other hand, and handcuffed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyd died from his gunshot wounds in the hospital the next day.  At a news conference several days later, APD Chief Gordon Eden announced that the officer-involved shooting was justified.&lt;sup class="footnoteref"&gt;[&lt;a class="footnote" href="#_footnote_16" title="View footnote."&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January of 2015, in an exceptional move which brings a challenge to the  sovereignty of the police, Bernalillo County District Attorney has brought murder charges against the two officers who shot Boyd.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_18" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_18" title="View footnote."&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; The charges came in the wake of almost six months of large protests across the nation after district attorneys in several jurisdictions failed to indict police officers who shot and killed unarmed black men. Whether the charges will result in a criminal trial depends on the outcome of the preliminary hearing which will be held in a few months&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;at which point the charges may be downgraded or dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="_department_of_justice_investigation"&gt;Department of Justice Investigation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Boyd&amp;#8217;s shooting, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice was already investigating the APD for its large number of shootings (37 since 2010) and apparent pattern of other uses of excessive force during arrests. After the video of Boyd&amp;#8217;s death was released, and after hundreds of riotous protesters demanded reform to the police department,&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_19" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_19" title="View footnote."&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry wrote a letter to the DoJ requesting that they expedite their investigation.&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_20" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_20" title="View footnote."&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; The DoJ complied, and on April 10, 2014, about 17 months after the investigation began, it released its findings in the form of a 46-page letter to the mayor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings did not address the Boyd shooting because it is still under criminal investigation. It did, however, refer to Chief Eden&amp;#8217;s comments at the press conference as evidence &amp;#8220;that more work is needed to change the culture of APD.&amp;#8221; (4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the findings letter, the DoJ found &amp;#8220;that the department engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force during the course of arrests and other detentions in violation of the Fourth Amendment&amp;#8221; stemming &amp;#8220;from systemic deficiencies in oversight, training, and policy.&amp;#8221; The report also noted that &amp;#8220;A significant amount of the force we reviewed was used against persons with mental illness and in crisis.&amp;#8221; (9-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those and similar findings from the DoJ investigation reveal how members of the Albuquerque Police Department routinely constitute themselves as little sovereigns acting in &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; states of exception by suspending the constitutional rights of their victims, especially those subjects with mental illness and in crisis who misfit within and are excluded from the political life of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final illustration of how both police (who are excepted from the normal prohibitions of the law) and homeless (who are excepted from the normal protections of the law) share in what Agamben calls the &amp;#8220;relation of exception,&amp;#8221; here is an account from the DoJ findings letter of an incident in which police confronted an angry 75-year-old homeless man named &amp;#8220;Ben&amp;#8221; who depends upon a cane to walk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The incident happened in September 2012 after officers responded to a bus station because Ben refused to leave. When officers arrived, they offered to take Ben to a homeless shelter and also called a Crisis Intervention Team officer to assist. Ben sat on a bench and told officers that he was not going to leave peacefully and that he was angry with the bus company for refusing to let him board. After officers tried to convince him to leave for about an hour, Ben threatened bus company employees and reached for his cane. Officers ordered him to put his cane down, but he refused. As Ben was trying to stand up using his cane (presumably for support), the CIT-trained officer shot Ben in the abdomen with his Taser. He did so even though the threat from Ben was minimal: Ben had trouble walking on his own, a sergeant and three officers were standing around him, and there were no indications that bystanders were near Ben. The sergeant on the scene found the Taser use reasonable, as did other supervisors. One supervisor praised the officers' conduct as &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;exceptional&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221; (18, emphasis added)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="_first_some_reasons_i_don_t_not_vote"&gt;First Some Reasons I Don&amp;#8217;t Not Vote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many libertarians consider voting in political elections to be either a waste of time, a breach of their anti-authoritarian principles, or an act of aggression and otherwise morally unjustifiable. I am a non-voter myself, but my abstention is not primarily motivated by any of those considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think there is anything inherently immoral about voting or elections. Voting is merely a form of communication, a formal (or not-so-formal) registration of an opinion serving to help individuals choose as a group between mutually exclusive options. Whether deciding where to eat or electing a chief executive for your favorite democratic republic, voting is useful. There are reasons democracy works so well in so many settings, and they go beyond simple fairness. Voting, especially in large, heterogeneous groups, is effective at both processing localized information which would have escaped a central decision-maker and at minimizing partiality toward specific individuals or factions. Decentralized decision-making also diffuses authority and its abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political races for high-profile offices seem to almost always produce candidates to nobody&amp;#8217;s liking, forcing voters to adopt the lesser evil principle: voting for whichever candidate they think will be the least unfit or do the least damage. (This seems most likely in a two-party winner-take-all system, but I suspect there are enough politicians in the world that the lesser evil principle would easily generalize to a system with a large number of candidates and winners.) Some purists use this phenomena as an argument against voting. &amp;#8220;The lesser of evils is still evil,&amp;#8221; they say, and then absolutely refuse all options. But, assuming the office in question should exist in the first place, the &amp;#8220;evil&amp;#8221; rhetoric is simply an expression of the relatively strong disfavor voters hold even for the &amp;#8220;best,&amp;#8221; or better, viable candidate. The ranking is ordinal. Supposing again the office in question is necessary, we could shift the rhetorical scales and speak of &amp;#8220;the best of two goods.&amp;#8221; We&amp;#8217;d have lost the expression of strong disfavour for both candidates, but the phrase would still be accurate in that it unambiguously refers to the same candidate. In other words, the &amp;#8220;evil&amp;#8221; in the lesser evil principle is more rhetorical than moral, and so it does not justify purists' moral abstention. It does not follow that because no option is ideal, no choice should be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not think the widespread frustration with the choice of viable candidates at election time is simply an unfortunate coincidence which happens every election cycle. One hope for democracy in the classical liberal tradition was that it would do away with favoritism and replace the selective edicts of absolute sovereigns with the rule of law. The limited democracy of republicanism goes even further by attempting to constrain the tyranny of majorities. That is, one goal of republicanism is to have a government made up of representatives who are favored by the many generally but not the few (including local majorities) specifically. Given a sufficiently large discrepancy in preferences of voters, then, an electoral process which produces candidates viewed almost universally as &amp;#8220;evil&amp;#8221; is a feature of liberal republicanism, not a bug. In fact, Madison&amp;#8217;s argument in &lt;a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm"&gt;Federalist No. 10&lt;/a&gt; (for example) is that republics should be large (and unlike democracies, can be large) to make it less likely that any local majority should be able to &amp;#8220;execute their plans of oppression.&amp;#8221; Large republics are also likely to have larger discrepancies in preferences among its electorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;#8217;t accept the &amp;#8220;there are no good choices&amp;#8221; complaint as a strong argument against voting. In fact, although Madison obviously imagined more parties existing than the current duopoly which dominates American politics, viable candidates that nobody likes may be a sign that the system is working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an anti-authoritarian perspective, which rejects the necessity of far-removed representatives holding inherently-authoritarian positions in the first place, on the other hand, the office itself and therefore almost any candidate seeking it would be viewed as actually evil. A strong libertarian argument against supporting (even merely with a vote) &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; candidate for such an office could be made. Elections thus present most libertarians with at least a moral hesitation: &lt;em&gt;By voting am I consenting to or endorsing an authoritarian political system? Does it make sense to select a ruler for myself? for my neighbors?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also: &lt;em&gt;If I don&amp;#8217;t vote, will I be complicit in allowing an even worse outcome than was possible?&lt;/em&gt; This dilemma can and has been answered from libertarian perspective in favour of voting when faced with two competing but unequal evil options. For example, leading up to the 2008 US presidential elections Noam Chomsky argued that &amp;#8220;There is nothing immoral about voting for the lesser of two evils. In a powerful system like ours, small changes can lead to big consequences.&amp;#8221; &lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical motivation behind Chomsky&amp;#8217;s chaos-theoretic defense of voting is similar to arguments that the use of the ballot, like the weapons placed in the hands of gladiators forced to battle each other, is a form of self defense. &lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote."&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; These defenses of voting admit there is a level of implied coercion in the ballot, but seek to justify that force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_it_s_ghosts_all_the_way_down"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Ghosts All the Way Down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw in all of the above arguments in favour of voting, and in most of those against it, is that they assume the efficacy of voting reaches further than it does. That&amp;#8217;s not to say that voting is ineffectual in the sense of the famous aphorism attributed to Emma Goldman, &amp;#8220;If voting changed anything, they&amp;#8217;d make it illegal.&amp;#8221; Electoral politics will never bring about the sort of revolutionary changes Goldman wanted to see, granted. But as Chomsky pointed out, the outcome of an election can still have a consequential effect which may be worth caring about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#8217;t mean that voting is a waste of time, even though it is (from a decision-theoretic perspective). Since the chance of any single vote being pivotal in the election is nearly zero, and there are non-zero costs (like the time it takes to register and fill out and mail in a ballot) involved, it is necessary to posit some kind of consumption benefit beyond choosing a winner to explain why so many people turn out to vote. As I explain in this section, I believe at least a large part of that consumption benefit for many people can be explained as the religious-like duties they satisfy by voting. In their article &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/magazine/06freak.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;Why Vote?&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; Dubner and Levitt (the &lt;em&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/em&gt; authors) interpret a Swiss study to suggest that one consumption benefit of voting is the social recognition received just by being seen fulfilling the civic duty of voting. This is reminiscent of the vainly religious who attend church or otherwise flaunt their religiosity for the sake of being seen acting piously. &lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote."&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean is the more obvious, that voting literally, in a mechanical sense, accomplishes very little: registering a preference with a ballot doesn&amp;#8217;t actually effect much beyond leaving a mark on a piece of paper (or whatever method is used to record the vote). Even if the process of collecting, interpreting, and counting the ballots is so reliable that voting can be considered to directly determine the outcome of the election, there is still a leap of faith required to get from the announced election results to the acceptance of those results in the minds of the electorate (and the entire body politic). A candidate doesn&amp;#8217;t receive political power and responsibility from a vote count but from the public behaving as if the winning candidate, instead of somebody else or nobody, has those powers and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the initial leap of faith required to accept a new (or first, I suppose) representative, political power only continues to exists as long as it is recognized as legitimate in the minds of the faithful. Such reified ideas which an individual encounters as something alien and set above herself as a cause or duty are what &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Stirner"&gt;Max Stirner&lt;/a&gt; calls &amp;#8220;spooks&amp;#8221; haunting the mind. The entire electoral process depends on an electorate haunted by such spooks as Civic Duty, Patriotism and allegiance to parties, sacrosanct Democracy, and the like.  Politicians do not wield any actual, physical power over the political body. The phantasmal machinery of politics only becomes real through the violence of its possessed subjects which are bound against each other with ghoulish chains-of-command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation that political power comes not from votes but from belief suggests a corollary: that there is no fundamental difference between a democratic government and any other government; to turn Jonathan Swift&amp;#8217;s normative phrase into a tautology, all governments rule by the consent of the governed.&amp;#8203;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote."&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Of course not everybody is possessed by the morality of the state to recognize its legitimacy or the authority of its agents.  While most politicians enjoy the support of a haunted majority, they certainly don&amp;#8217;t need more than a very small portion of the public to believe in the state to maintain power, and they always need a way to control those whose own morality hasn&amp;#8217;t been displaced by that of the state. &lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_5" title="View footnote."&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; They need only enough &amp;#8220;moral&amp;#8221; individuals to act as soldiers and police and prison guards. Of course the chains-of-command which hold the whole state together are designed to effectively funnel commands from executives and magistrates to police and soldiers, who are so possessed by morality, by duty, that they have convinced (or frightened) themselves to always obey, while dissipating the responsibility of that obedience to nowhere, to the nonexistent conscience of a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s what government is: a shared delusion, a ghostlike hierarchy and a whole tangled hierarchy of ghosts in the minds of its subjects. It is a religion, and voting is one of its sacred rites. Those who attribute magic to that ritual, whether they believe it be for good or evil, have bought into the superstition of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_why_i_don_t_vote"&gt;Why I Don&amp;#8217;t Vote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its own, such a Stirnerist deconstruction of voting doesn&amp;#8217;t decide the question, &lt;em&gt;Should I vote?&lt;/em&gt; An egoist might acknowledge the spooks, then, owning her ability to vote rather than being owned by any sense of duty, proceed to vote (or not) to further her own interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his essay, &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://socialmemorycomplex.net/leftlibertarian/2010/01/24/the-apostasy-of-the-anarchist-vote/"&gt;The Apostasy of the Anarchist Vote&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; the left libertarian writer Jeremy Weiland uses a similar egoist analysis of voting to argue that it is okay and possibly at times preferable for anarchists to vote. In that essay (directed towards anarchists) Weiland asks a good question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the end, it is the behavior, not the myths and abstractions, that matter. So if by voting, you can engage with your neighbors to influence them within this mixed society, or possibly influence state actors to behave more peaceably, why would you insist on abstaining?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do I insist on abstaining? I don&amp;#8217;t vote because external authorities are less dangerous than the spooks which rule our minds. &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nrsv/Mt10.28"&gt;Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221; Political rulers (or at least those who believe in and obey them) kill the body; the religion of Civic Duty kills the soul. I&amp;#8217;m not satisfied with a cowardly egoism which allows me to seek my own interests while leaving others to their demons. Such a naive egoism is self-defeating: I cannot be free in an unfree society. &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1871/man-society.htm"&gt;I am truly free only when all human beings, men and women, are equally free. &amp;#8230;&amp;#8203; My personal freedom, confirmed by the liberty of all, extends to infinity.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;#8217;t vote for exactly the reason Weiland suggests that anarchists might vote: as pedagogical engagement with my neighbors. Weiland concludes that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vote is a meaningless, superstitious ritual that masks deeper social issues and sanctions nothing. It does not bolster our argument to agree with statists that elections matter. Instead, we should treat them as what they are: the trivial rites of a false religion.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With which I completely agree, although I hold that the way to engage with a false religion is not to join in its meaningless rituals, but to blaspheme those sacred rites in plain view of its adherents. That, at least, has a chance of capturing their attention and bringing the spooks into the purview of their conscious minds where they can be devoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everywhere is different, of course, but where I live (white, educated, &amp;#8216;middle class&amp;#8217; America) voting is a normative process which works to condition people to accept the state apparatus and its (sometimes horrific) results. People here are &amp;#8220;supposed&amp;#8221; to vote, and when they encounter one of their peers who refuses to do so it opens up an opportunity for them to question their acceptance of the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This individualism with an emphasis on pedagogical outreach is a very Cynical endeavor, and I know of no better place to seek guidance in confronting the ghost of Civic Duty than those ancient philosophers. The Cynics went out of their way to blaspheme with anti-political lifestyles, satire, and theatrical spectacle the sacred rites of the &lt;em&gt;polis&lt;/em&gt; for the benefit of their audience. As Diogenes said, &amp;#8220;Other dogs bite only their enemies, whereas I bite also my friends in order to save them.&amp;#8221; &lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_6" title="View footnote."&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting is held so sacred by some that mere abstention is enough to scandalize them (and maybe jolt them back to conscious thought). But what might a proper Cynic response to election day myths look like? Here&amp;#8217;s an anecdote about Diogenes, as recalled by Lucian of Samosata, which might provide some inspiration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A report that Philip was marching on the town had thrown all Corinth into a bustle; one was furbishing his arms, another wheeling stones, a third patching the wall, a fourth strengthening a battlement, every one making himself useful somehow or other. Diogenes having nothing to do&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;of course no one thought of giving him a job&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;was moved by the sight to gird up his philosopher&amp;#8217;s cloak and begin rolling his tub-dwelling energetically up and down the Craneum; an acquaintance asked, and got, the explanation: &amp;#8216;I do not want to be thought the only idler in such a busy multitude; I am rolling my tub to be like the rest.&amp;#8217; &lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_7" title="View footnote."&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of quiet abstention or the usual protest vote campaigns, I&amp;#8217;d like to see something similar to Diogenes' take on the civic duty of war preparation: a satirization of the hustle and bustle of the voting ritual. A useless activity to point out the uselessness of the activity everybody else is taking so seriously. One idea: when engaged in electoral discussions, earnestly take the position that a vote for anyone but a satirical candidate (à la &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin_Supreme"&gt;Vermin Supreme&lt;/a&gt;) is a waste of a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="#_footnoteref_2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. An analogy first put forward by Lysander Spooner in &lt;a href="http://praxeology.net/LS-NT-2.htm#NT.2.1.12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Treason&lt;/em&gt; II.1.12&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve read many similar hypotheticals meant to justify voting for the lesser evil as a defensive measure, usually involving unlikely choices presented to slaves or some poor individual who is given the choice of abstention or the cataclysmic death of millions.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote" id="_footnote_3"&gt;
&lt;a href="#_footnoteref_3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;. Two good reviews of the academic literature on this &amp;#8220;paradox of (non) voting&amp;#8221; are &lt;a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/089533004773563458"&gt;Feddersen, Timothy J. 2004. &amp;#8220;Rational Choice Theory and the Paradox of Not Voting.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;Journal of Economic Perspectives&lt;/em&gt;, 18(1): 99–112&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.wzb.eu/sites/default/files/personen/geys.benny.328/polstudrev_4_1.pdf"&gt;Geys, B. (2006), ‘Rational’ Theories of Voter Turnout: A Review. &lt;em&gt;Political Studies Review&lt;/em&gt;, 4: 16–35&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote" id="_footnote_4"&gt;
&lt;a href="#_footnoteref_4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;. David Hume made a similar observation, that all governments are supported by opinion, in his essay &amp;#8220;Of The First Principles of Government&amp;#8221; (1742): &amp;#8220;Nothing appears more surprising to those who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye, than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few; and the implicit submission, with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers. When we enquire by what means this wonder is effected, we shall find, that, as Force is always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion. It is, therefore, on opinion only that government is founded; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments, as well as to the most free and most popular.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote" id="_footnote_5"&gt;
&lt;a href="#_footnoteref_5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;. Stirner, and most people, use the words &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;morality&lt;/em&gt; to denote living according to a haunted conscience, according to the dictates of an external code given by parents, religion, law, etc. In fact that is the exact opposite of morality; it is a counterfeit morality consisting of an alien concept acting as if it were an individual&amp;#8217;s autonomous conscience. See also my essay, &lt;a href="/log/2012/4/29/authority_or_autonomy/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Authority or Autonomy&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;

    <title type="html">Jesus on [Same-Sex] Marriage</title>
    <published>2012-05-25T20:06:48Z</published>
    <updated>2015-09-28T05:23:46Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no consensus as to what the purpose of marriage is. But whatever its purpose, it is political. Private friendships, romances, sexual partners, economic alliances, housemates and other relationships are sometimes subject to legal agreements of lease and contract. But more often they are informal and mutually beneficial arrangements. Marriage is all these relationships made public and explicit. It benefits from social recognition and acceptance in return for public accountability in ways that previously private (and often implicit) vows of commitment that create new families do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriage is how society&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;or its body of political representatives&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;controls the reproduction of society: who can legitimately rear children and inherit property. The state traditionally subsidizes favourable families and de-legitimizes (and sometimes criminalizes) unfavourable forms based on age, ethnicity, gender, consanguinity, number of spouses, or whatever other criteria creeps into the imagination of the masses and our masters as constituting a proper or &amp;#8220;natural&amp;#8221; union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twentieth century saw the end of so-called miscegenation laws; laws which were the result of a confused project to restrict the reproduction of American society based on ethnicity and skin color. For those who see through the distorted logic of racism, there remains no comprehensible reason to exclude families from social recognition based on arbitrary notions of &amp;#8220;race&amp;#8221; that too often grab hold of humanity&amp;#8217;s haunted mind. Likewise it is no easy task for many of us to understand those who currently wish to restrict marriage based on gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Obama recently evoked his Christianity in prompting his &lt;a href="/log/2012/5/25/obama_on_same-sex_marriage/"&gt;change of heart about same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;. Others have been known to appeal to Christianity to argue against same-sex marriage. In &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/readme/2003/07/abolish_marriage.html"&gt;his 2003 argument for privatizing marriage&lt;/a&gt;, one commentator wrote of the gay marriage debate, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s going to get ugly. And then it&amp;#8217;s going to get boring.&amp;#8221; Well, it&amp;#8217;s gotten boring. Nay, beyond boring, it&amp;#8217;s gotten frustratingly monotonous watching marginalized groups clamor for acceptance from their oppressors while all sides explain what Jesus would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of one vaguely philosophic, though not very compelling, argument against abstract homosexuality. That is an argument from teleology: since men and women are endowed with some complementary bits, they are naturally meant to pair off. That argument not only assumes a binary gender, but to apply it to marriage is to presuppose that the sole purpose of marriage is sex and biological reproduction. Nobody takes that position. Despite those apparent weaknesses, Jesus does use such a teleological argument against divorce in the accounts of Matthew and Mark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, &amp;#8220;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Haven&amp;#8217;t you read,&amp;#8221; he replied, &amp;#8220;that at the beginning the Creator &amp;#8216;made them male and female,&amp;#8217; and said, &amp;#8216;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh&amp;#8217;? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="attribution"&gt;
&amp;#8212; &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;Matthew 19:3-6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One great thing about Jesus' responses to the Pharisees is that he often confounds them by intentionally quoting passages of the Old Testament out of context (there&amp;#8217;s a lesson there about sacralizing a book). In Genesis (&lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A24&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;2:24&lt;/a&gt;), which Jesus is quoting, the reason men and women are compelled to unite as &amp;#8216;one flesh&amp;#8217; is because Woman was originally made from Adam&amp;#8217;s rib. It&amp;#8217;s an explanation for marriage, or at least of sexual union. Jesus divorces (pun!) the explanation (the rib story) from the result (the drive to sexual union) and substitutes the less etiological gender binary of Genesis 1:27 (&amp;#8216;male and female He created them&amp;#8217;) as an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 2, God separates Woman from Adam, and later men and women rejoin themselves in sexual union. In Matthew 19 Jesus ignores the mythology and reverses this story: &amp;#8220;Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.&amp;#8221; Now it is God doing the joining and people doing the separating. I&amp;#8217;ll give my high-level interpretation: Men and women are attracted to each other not because of some imaginative creation myth, but because that is the nature of mammals with their sexuality and whatnot.  Society will reproduce itself both biologically and culturally -- &amp;#8220;Life finds a way,&amp;#8221; as one chaos theorist put it. &lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Even well-meaning attempts at regulating reproduction by establishing legal institutions to control who can legitimately begin or dissolve a family aren&amp;#8217;t a part of Jesus' vision of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual the Pharisees don&amp;#8217;t quite catch that Jesus just reversed their assumptions and they continue their line of legal questioning: &amp;#8220;Well if God did not intend divorce, then why did Moses allow it?&amp;#8221; (Matthew 19:7). Jesus responds the same way he did in the Sermon on the Mount, by &lt;a href="/log/2012/4/29/authority_or_autonomy/"&gt;replacing law with morality&lt;/a&gt;. Moses told you not to murder; I tell you not to be angry. Moses told you not to commit adultery; I tell you not to lust. Moses told you to keep your oaths; I tell you not to make oaths, simply say &amp;#8216;yes&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;no&amp;#8217;. Moses said an eye for an eye; I say give to those who steal from you. Moses said love your neighbor; I say love your enemy. &lt;strong&gt;Moses told you to be civilized about divorce; I tell you that divorce is tantamount to adultery&lt;/strong&gt; (compare &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;Matthew 5:31&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;Matthew 19:8-9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To his disciples, marriage without divorce essentially made marriage unworkable (&amp;#8220;if this is the case, then it is neither profitable nor advisable to marry&amp;#8221;&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;which is what Diogenes was trying to say all along). Jesus' response was, &amp;#8220;then don&amp;#8217;t get married.&amp;#8221; Actually he said that not everybody could accept the teaching, but some will renounce marriage &amp;#8220;for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.&amp;#8221; As an aside, I&amp;#8217;ve always thought that his analogy about the eunuchs would be a good slogan for Linux: &amp;#8220;And there be Unix which have made themselves Unix for the kingdom of heaven&amp;#8217;s sake.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even though Jesus uses the limited gender-binary language of Genesis, his answer here can also be applied to the question of same-sex marriage: Don&amp;#8217;t let legal institutions separate what God has joined. More generally, don&amp;#8217;t let the state supplant your morality with its laws by dictating what kind of society you will produce and reproduce. I cannot see how gender similarities or differences play into that teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere Jesus took an even more explicit stance on marriage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sadducees,  who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. &amp;#8220;Teacher,&amp;#8221; they said, &amp;#8220;Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him. Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. Finally, the woman died. Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus replied, &amp;#8220;You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. &lt;strong&gt;At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage&lt;/strong&gt;; they will be like the angels in heaven. But about the resurrection of the dead&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;have you not read what God said to you, &amp;#8216;I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&amp;#8217;?  He is not the God of the dead but of the living.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="attribution"&gt;
&amp;#8212; &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;Matthew 22:23-31&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever literal resurrection the Sadducees had in mind which gave rise to paradoxes like the widow being married to all of her husbands in heaven, their vision was not the same as the one Jesus had been teaching in which &amp;#8220;people will neither marry nor be given in marriage.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;[&lt;a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote."&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; It&amp;#8217;s clear that whatever the concerns of the Life that Jesus taught, marriage is not one of them. As such, I do not believe it is consistent for anyone to appeal to Jesus' teachings to decide who should or should not be included in the legal institution of marriage, unless the answer is nobody. An appeal to Jesus in order to justify extending or denying the state privilege of marriage to certain populations requires ignoring the few things he is recorded as saying on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote" id="_footnote_1"&gt;
&lt;a href="#_footnoteref_1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, a fictional mathematician: Ian Malcolm from Michael Crichton&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;. In the motion picture adaptation, Dr. Malcom warns about the folly of trying to control the park&amp;#8217;s population by cloning only female dinosaurs: &amp;#8220;Life breaks free, expands to new territories, and crashes through barriers, painfully, maybe even dangerously &amp;#8230;&amp;#8203; I&amp;#8217;m simply saying that life finds a way.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote" id="_footnote_2"&gt;
&lt;a href="#_footnoteref_2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. Luke offers something of an explanation as to what Jesus meant by &amp;#8216;they will be like angels&amp;#8217;: "Jesus replied, &amp;#8216;The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God&amp;#8217;s children, since they are children of the resurrection.&amp;#8217; " (Luke 20:34-36)

    <title type="html">Biased Belief: Why the Mormon Missionaries Haven't Converted Me Yet</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a friend of mine left for Brazil to serve his two-year mission with the LDS church after graduating high school, I began meeting with pairs of missionaries at home. After almost nine years of these occasional discussions, I think I have a pretty good idea of what they believe, and why I don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_mormon_recap"&gt;Mormon Recap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First a quick recapitulation for those who aren&amp;#8217;t familiar with Mormonism: the Latter Day Saint Movement, or &amp;#8220;Mormonism,&amp;#8221; got its start during the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening"&gt;Second Great Awakening&lt;/a&gt; (1820&amp;#8217;s) in western New York when a farm boy named &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith"&gt;Joseph Smith&lt;/a&gt; got fed up with the infighting of the various Christian sects and decided to ask God which church was the True church. God answered by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Vision"&gt;appearing in person&lt;/a&gt; and telling Joseph that none of the current churches had the full truth. Eventually God used Joseph as a latter-day prophet to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_(Latter_Day_Saints)"&gt;restore&lt;/a&gt; the full gospel to Earth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was shown the location of an ancient American record, and given the ability to translate it to English as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (Mormon being the name of the ancient historian who compiled the book, written on metal plates, from the records available to him. It was Mormon&amp;#8217;s son, Moroni, who hid the plates and later appeared to Joseph as an angel and told him where to find them buried in a hillside in New York.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was &lt;a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.69-72?lang=eng#68"&gt;visited by John the Baptist&lt;/a&gt;, and later by other New Testement personages, which conferred to him the authority of previously lost &lt;a href="http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Priesthood"&gt;priesthoods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He organized the church, founded cities, and introduced some of the unique theological concepts associated with Mormonism: that God has &lt;a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22?lang=eng#21"&gt;a physical body&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href="http://www.lds.org/ensign/1996/11/the-eternal-family?lang=eng"&gt;families are eternal&lt;/a&gt;, and that, for 50 years during the late 19th century, some families were better off with one husband and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_polygamy"&gt;several wives&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the largest organization in the Latter Day Saint tradition is the &lt;a href="http://www.lds.org/?lang=eng"&gt;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; based in Salt Lake City, Utah. That church has an impressive missionary program, sending out pairs of young missionaries to cities all over the world to teach the doctrines of the church and seek converts. It is with these missionaries that I&amp;#8217;ve been meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="_the_one_essential_claim_of_mormonism"&gt;The one essential claim of Mormonism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty to talk about, from church history to theology. Most missionaries are happy to discuss their claims both rationally and empirically (from archeology to textual criticism). But, ultimately, Mormonism can be distilled to one truth-claim: that the priesthood authority was restored by God through Joseph Smith. This is what the church &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;; the line of prophets established by God is once again on Earth, and this authority alone holds the keys necessary for humans to reach their intended destiny. And there is but one way to know the truth of that claim: subjectively, by the help of the holy spirit, you must recognize the truth in your own mind and heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the modus operandi of missionaries is not to convince investigators that the church is true in order to lead them to accept its doctrines; rather it is to present the doctrines (their teaching on families or the existence of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt;, for example) as reasons why the church could be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_the_prophet_complex_theory_of_joseph_smith"&gt;The Prophet Complex Theory of Joseph Smith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theory is that Joseph Smith was motivated by what I call the Prophet Complex. Like most of us, he would sometimes get excited about his ideas: when he had a moment of insight or a personal breakthrough in harmonizing contradictory ideas he had been struggling with or when he discovered an explanation or object he found elegant or beautiful. Unlike most of us, he interpreted his feelings, the stirrings in his chest, not as mere excitement but as divine validation of his ideas. Few things induce as much excitement within a person as romantic attraction or in discovering what appears to be a metaphysical or scientific truth about the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory easily leads to a &amp;#8220;pious fraud&amp;#8221; theory of why Joseph Smith would pass his own ideas off as divine revelations, and, as I see it, successfully accounts for several historical facts about Smith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a teen he made a living as a  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying"&gt;scryer&lt;/a&gt;: he convinced himself, or at least his employers, that by gazing into seer stones he could divine the location of hidden treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was devoted to his wife, Emma, until his death. Emma&amp;#8217;s father refused to sanction the marriage, so she and Joseph eloped. According to at least &lt;a href="http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/transcripts/?id=46"&gt;one account&lt;/a&gt;, not until Joseph married Emma, and brought her with him, was he allowed to finally retrieve the golden plates from which he translated the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his devotion to Emma, he took several other wives and introduced polygamy as an acceptable family structure among the saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believed he was a prophet of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see a similar epistemological method being taught by the missionaries today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_mormon_epistemology_burning_bosoms_and_confirmation_bias"&gt;Mormon Epistemology: Burning Bosoms and Confirmation Bias&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in my first discussions with the missionaries, they presented &lt;a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5?lang=eng"&gt;Moroni&amp;#8217;s promise&lt;/a&gt;, found in the last chapter of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt;, to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="attribution"&gt;
&amp;#8212; Moroni 10
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you do manage to overcome the bootstrap problem of &amp;#8220;having faith in Christ&amp;#8221; in order to find out if His church is true, how does the power of the holy ghost manifest that truth? One oft-quoted Mormon scripture is a revelation given to Oliver Cowdery after his attempt at translating the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; plates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="attribution"&gt;
&amp;#8212; &lt;a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8?lang=eng#8"&gt;Doctrine &amp;amp; Covenants 9:8&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I would ask the missionaries what the feeling was like when they finally had the truth manifested within them, most of them explained that it wasn&amp;#8217;t a single experience but a conspiracy of feelings, thoughts, and events which lead them to their divine knowledge. The overarching theme was that the more I would pray for specific answers, the more I would experiment and invest myself in the teachings, then the more likely I would be to &amp;#8220;feel that it is right&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="_the_experiment_alma_32"&gt;The Experiment - Alma 32&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one chapter of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; I was asked by my missionaries to read the most often was &lt;a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng"&gt;Alma 32&lt;/a&gt;. Part of this chapter is a sermon by Alma, using a metaphor of a seed, on how one can cultivate faith and belief. It is an excellent example of Mormon epistemology and can even be read as Joseph Smith&amp;#8217;s own apology for his revelations. I&amp;#8217;ll quote the bulk of it beginning at verse 27 adding emphasis to important bits I&amp;#8217;ll discuss below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quoteblock"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, &lt;strong&gt;even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe&lt;/strong&gt; in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, &lt;strong&gt;if it be a true seed, or a good seed&lt;/strong&gt;, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, &lt;strong&gt;it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions&lt;/strong&gt;, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="literalblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[...]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own alikeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="attribution"&gt;
&amp;#8212; Alma
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="_confirmation_bias"&gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alma suggests an experiment: believe, or at least &lt;em&gt;desire&lt;/em&gt; to believe, something is true. If it turns out to be good, then you know it is true and worth believing; otherwise forget it. This is an approach to knowledge that is exceedingly prone to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;: the tendency to favor information that confirms preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="_observer_expectancy_effect"&gt;Observer-Expectancy Effect&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missionaries would often use this scripture to ask me to conduct various &amp;#8216;experiments&amp;#8217; to help me recognize the manifestations of the holy spirit. Worse, they would often use methods which introduced further bias. For example they would ask me to pray by asking God if the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; was true. They would then bear testimony that they &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; is true and they are sure if I&amp;#8217;m sincere then I will come to know as well. At our next meeting they would ask me what I felt when I was reading and praying, especially did I feel good or peaceful (as if the only way I would feel peaceful while reading is if the holy spirit were speaking to me). That technique, suggesting what an investigator will feel when they pray, is prone to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect"&gt;observer-expectancy effect&lt;/a&gt; in which the missionaries' cognitive bias affects the investigator&amp;#8217;s. It is an attempt to avoid this bias that many courts do not allow leading questions during direct examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="_sunk_costs"&gt;Sunk Costs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other experiments included changes to my lifestyle (praying everyday and attending church service and events). Whenever I didn&amp;#8217;t receive a testimony of the truth of the church, the solution was to suggest more ways I could become invested in the church. One sister missionary, in all sincerity, suggested I be baptized into the church because she thought that would help me gain a testimony. I was reminded of the part of &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&lt;/em&gt; when Tom is trying to convince Jim to tame a rattlesnake: &amp;#8220;Blame it, can&amp;#8217;t you TRY? I only WANT you to try — you needn&amp;#8217;t keep it up if it don&amp;#8217;t work.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique of asking investigators to spend more of their time &amp;#8216;experimenting&amp;#8217; is prone to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_escalation"&gt;escalation of commitment&lt;/a&gt;: the investigator has so much invested in the truth of the church that they will tend to believe it is true without sufficient reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="_falsifiability_and_the_prophet_complex"&gt;Falsifiability and the Prophet Complex&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case neither Moroni&amp;#8217;s promise nor the experiment of the seed are useful in determining the truth of the church. Moroni&amp;#8217;s promise presupposes the truth: either the investigator has it confirmed by the holy spirit, or they didn&amp;#8217;t pray sincerely (or they just haven&amp;#8217;t waited or invested enough yet). Alma&amp;#8217;s experiment doesn&amp;#8217;t test for truth, it tests whether an idea is good or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that early in the passage I quoted above Alma equates &amp;#8220;true seed&amp;#8221; with &amp;#8220;good seed&amp;#8221;. From then on he only discusses what is &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221;. He even uses the metaphor of a growing plant to explain the physical feeling of swelling emotions which occur when an idea is good. This is the prophet complex! Alma 32 contains insight into the internal justifications of a pious fraud. It seems likely to me that in Joseph Smith&amp;#8217;s mind if an idea &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; good enough after consideration, then it also passed the test of truthfulness. Indeed many members of the LDS church, the so-called &lt;a href="http://newordermormon.org/"&gt;Cultural Mormons&lt;/a&gt;, are members precisely because they believe the church is good though not necessarily true. While interesting, it is not a path to knowledge I would take for myself and I do not consider Mormonism to be on firm epistemological ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="_conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course none of my observations preclude the possibility of personal revelation, and it is certainly possible that the missionaries I&amp;#8217;ve talked to believe because they have direct and irrefutable knowledge from God that Joseph Smith was a prophet, that the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; is an ancient record, and that the church&amp;#8217;s priesthood is based on divine authority. If that&amp;#8217;s the case, outside of me having my own mystical experience, there is no good way for me to confirm their claims. I remain unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
